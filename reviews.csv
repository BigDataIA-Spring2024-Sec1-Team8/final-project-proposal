"I wear tights to work on meeting days and love the Semi Sheer Opaque in Black so you still see your skin underneath but they're dark enough to match my boots and outfits. These are reinforced so they control your stomach and keep everything perfectly hidden. They come in 3 colors, black, cappuccino and natural if you want them to look like your natural skin. They are very soft, easy to put on and comfortable. These are very true to size and fit as expected.  I purchased this product at a discount for my unbiased review. These add a professional element to my work clothes.",Look and Feel Great,5120053475
"Color: DAY 20 Naturale TG2

Size: Small

These pantyhose by Veneziana comes in 3 different colors to choose from: Black, Natural and Cappucinno.  I have the Natural one and it is really more of a Nude Color.  The material feels silky and luxurious.

The waistband is soft and comfortable and offer adequate control.  They are sheer and opaque pantyhose that does not feel thin and easy to rip.  I appreciate that it is a product import from Italy and the size is true to one I typically purchase in the USA.

In conclusion, I rate this Women Pantyhose by Veneziana 5 out of 5 Stars. It is a comfortable and a quality product I recommend.

"I received these tights in the natural color; and it is exactly that - a natural look, without being too dark or light. The waist band is tight enough to stay up, without causing unwanted lumps. The quality is outstanding! Perfect for everyday use; and definitely will not tear the first wear - like many other tights. The silky material flows smoothly on the skin and stays in place all day. Received at a discount for my honest review.",No Rips; Excellent Quality!,5120053475
I'm usually a large but I ordered an extra large. I think I could've fit in the large though since the back is stretchy. Overall good material and arrived fast.,Fits great/Good Material,6040972467

"This was too big for me in the bust area (and I think the waist too). I'm small though. I'm about 100 lbs. and 5'3"". I would have to take it in to wear it. This might be a normal ""larger small"" size that I run into a lot when looking for clothes. The dress didn't look like anything really special, though I might would have thought differently if it fit me right (but it might have also been the material). I felt like I had wasted money, but I kept in it hopes of adjusting it.",Eh. Lol. Too big for my little size.,6040972467

"The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design. However, a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars. First, even with the adjustable straps (which are nice), the chest area is way too low. I'm nursing (one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D, and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath. I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v-neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way. Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice.

The other issue I have with this design is that it's advertised as being red and white. It is so far from being red. It's pink, almost hot pink. I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design, but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink. I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much.

Essentially, it's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit. Not sheer (I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through), and very flattering. I actually bought another pattern of this dress a few weeks after buying this one because I liked the fit and design so much.","The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design",6040972467
"I am very pleased with this dress! I wasn't sure what size to get when I ordered it, so I got an XL (I'm about 5'7"" and weigh 210lbs). I was pleased to see that this has smocking in the back which gives it a bit of stretch. It is very comfortable, and is exactly the look I was going for. I will probably buy a couple more dresses from this brand, although I may go down a size as I am in the process of losing weight and would like to be able to keep wearing them.
I added a picture of the back of the dress, one without a petticoat, and the last picture is the dress with a petticoat. I bought ""Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat White(L)"" on Amazon to go with this dress. Please note that as this dress is cut to have a big circle skirt it tends to be much more flattering if you do decide to add a petticoat underneath it.",Perfect Comfortable Summer Dress!,6040972467

"I really like the print and the fit. The colors are fairly close to the photo and the cut flatters most figures. I returned it because it will require a lot of ironing and won't pack well for the cruise that I bought it for. It is woven 100% viscose. It has to be hand washed and line dried and will wrinkle very easily. If you're willing to do the work, it's a nice dress.",I really like the print and the fit,6040974753

You asked about the fit. It was a perfect fit for me.  I would have normally bought a size large  in USA I am a 1214. But, I bought an extra large in the UK size and it fit like the USA large.

"This watch was only about $13 shipped, so I'm not going to complain that much. It tells time, and that's what it is supposed to do. The buttons however need to be in a different place. I have to reach all the way over to the left top button to turn on the light to see the time in the dark. That is already a hassle when holding something in my right hand (I wear the watch on my left wrist), but to top it off, you need to hold down the button to keep the light on. Maybe I'm spoiled, but that seems ridiculous. I have had plenty of watches by Casio and all of them kept the light on for a few seconds when you pressed the light button. There aren't any fancy modes on this watch, like stopwatch or timer. The only modes are Time, Alarm, and Set Time. There isn't even a dedicated button for adjusting the time; you have to hit the mode button until the seconds start flashing. This watch is fine for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and only wants to tell time, but the light should at least stay on for a few seconds.",OK for the price; needs better button arrangement,9792252916
This is the 3rd one of these watches my husband has bought over a period of around 8 years. Cheap and cheerful - not worth the cost of a new battery so we just replace it each time. Overall a great watch for the money.,3rd one purchased,9792252916

"3 and a half stars.
First, the Amazon Partner who is selling this, J & R Music & Computer World, gets a 5 star rating from me, the watch arrived very fast and in excellent condition.
The watch itself gets the 3 and a half because, while the actual purchase price is ""$9.99"", the crossed-out list price is ""$24.95"". I expected a little more from a $25.00 Casio. My complaints: The illumination is a small side light, not an entire screen brightness like with other Casios or Indiglow style. The stop-watch goes only to 59 Minutes, 59 Seconds.
Good things:
1-button press to go from 12 to 24 hour time, alarm function, hourly beep, light weight, slim profile, 50 meter water resistant, 7-year battery, and easy to use.
Maybe I'm overly critical, this is a good $10.00 watch, but an average $25.00 watch.

[EDIT]:
Having had this watch for several months now, I find that it keeps better time than a much more expensive digital watch that I had bought at Disney World. The Disney watch looks great and is all metal, but runs faster than the Casio. I compare and set the time of all my watches to my Casio Atomic/Solar MTG920DA, which receives a time calibration every day from the Atomic clock in Fort Collins, CO.",Good Basic Digital Watch - 3 and a half stars,9792252916

"My garden clogs make my feet look huge, and even with socks I had to order a smaller size.  Generally I can count on being an easy 7, but had to buy a 6, and still have quite a bit of room.  I use these in the yard, at the pool, riding my bike, shopping and have even been known to accidentally wear them to work.  They are more comfy than sneakers, and have wonderful arch supports built in - important for me and a heel spur I have been dealing with for a number of years now.  Teenagers seem to think they are cool too, and the navy upper really might pass as leather if you don't look too close.  Great with jeans.

"These shoes were recommended to me by a several coworkers and friends of mine. We work in the Veterinary nursing field, which involves a lot of standing, kneeling, etc. I bought both the 39 and the 40 as I can go either way with different brands. The 39s fit perfectly around my foot, but my toes were smushed and hitting the front of the shoe. The 40s were so big that even with socks on they flopped like flip flops when I walked, which was a deal breaker for me, so I returned them.","Too small or too big, they did not fit.",B00004VWJ3

"I've owned probably a dozen pair of this shoe over the years, I've been wearing something else recently and was excited to get back to this old trustworthy shoe.  It seems like something has changed in the sizing.  I've been a 48 in birkenstock of all types since I first purchased birkenstock.  I did once have to buy a smaller size (46) because I was in a bind and I ended up buying another (correct, 48) pair a couple weeks later.  This feels like that smaller sized shoe, like a 46.  The box says 48, the inside of the shoe says 48, it's disappointing",did the sizes change?,B00004VWJ3

I bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase.  The only trouble I have had is with the clasp.

"I bought this as my everyday watch and love it!  I'm very happy with the ultrathin band that lays down nicely on my wrist and doesn't catch at my arm hairs like chain links do.  The only complaint, and this is a very minor one, is that the adjustable band wasn't made for someone who's wrist is as thin as mine- 5.5 inches around.

The mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear, you don't even feel it against your skin. I have a two-tone Movado and I far prefer my $89 Skagen to my $900 Movado.

"I purchased this watch in December 2012 for myself as a Christmas present.  I needed a silver watch to match other silver jewelry and this one was very pretty.  I'd heard that the Skagen brand was very dependable, but I have found this to not be the case.  The watch was only used one time , this year in fact.  I had a new battery installed and it ran for about 2 hours.  I found that if I continued to shake it, it would run but as soon as I stopped it stopped after about 30 minutes.  The jewelry repair rep had me bring it back to see if the connections were meeting and they were.  The screw to wound the watch is so tiny I could barely grasp it.  Imagine trying to keep it set...smh!  The clasp is difficult to latch but that wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many other problems.  The watch is a waste of money and I will never buy another one.",Looks are very much deceiving!!!,B0000643Q6
"This watch is a great value for the price. If your like me and don't like huge watches but want something nice looking in a men's watch, Skagan has found a niche. Had mine for over 4 years and not one problem. Been running fine since the day I bought it. I am not the most careful guy with my things so scratch resistence is a must on a watch. Not a scratch yet. All in all a great simple, elegant looking watch.","Thin, lightweight, and sleek.",B0000643Q8
"First thing you'll notice about this watch is its incredible weight.  It's super light compared to those big clunky stainless steel watches.  I had this watch for over 5 years, and I got scratches on the crystal from normal use.  So don't expect this thing to be completely scratch resistant.

Well the low ratings has to due with the poor service and build quality.  The ""chrome indicators"" that mark the hours actually came loose inside my watch.  I sent it to Skagen under their lifetime warranty to repair it.  Guess what, it happed THREE times already...same exact problem.  I've spent over 30$ just shipping the watch back and forth.

Again, I really like the watch, but the problems with things falling out, and poor repair service, I can only rate this watch a 3 star.",Great design..but quality is terrible,B0000643Q8
"This is the second version of this watch that I have owned.  The first one got some water in it after wearing it in a jacuzzi so the water resisitant is pretty liberal.  This watch has a very classic look and I frequently get comments on it.  I also own the same one in Black and both are pretty much identical.

Skagen was one of the first brands to go titanium in both the watch and bands and more and more companies are switching.  Titanium is lighter and stronger than regular steel and once you go Titanium, you won't go back.

This watch has a small face so its perfect for people with average to small wrist sizes.  Some of these watches have faces that are so big its like wearing a tea saucer on your wrist and it's an eysore.  This watch is a revelation to smaller wrists everywhere.  Also the band on this watch does not grab your wrist hair (VERY IMPORTANT!).

One disadvantage of this watch is the lack of features.  Its got the date and thats about it.  Also the ticking from the watch is loud enought that you sometimes notice it if the watch is within about 2 feet of your ears and the room is silent.  I wouldn't normally go to bed with this watch or store it nearby while sleeping.

Bottom Line:  A classy and durable dress watch appropriate for any non athletic situation.  I highly recommend it and well worth the money.",A beautifull watch but not for everyone...,B0000643Q8

Then lo and behold, my eyes were drawn to this Skagen. At last, I had found a sleek watch with classic styling that didn't cost a fortune, and that you don't see everywhere! I was excited. And you know what? After three years, I still love it! It still looks great (it shrugs off hard knocks very well), keeps fantastic time, and draws the occasional compliment to boot! I couldn't have asked for more from a watch.",Functional Elegance,B0000643Q8
"I love this watch.  I got it in July and man it is awesome!  It's so light that you wouldn't believe you're wearing it.  I worked at Starbucks for 6 months and banged it around and no scrathes at all on the hard mineral crystal.  It's not scratch resistent, but i've never gotten any nicks at all.

People from various age groups (teenager, mom, yuppies) have asked about the watch because it's a subtle classy elegant watch.  This would make a great present for that special someone or for yourself.

If you want to adjust the chain, go to a local watch shop.  It should take less than 5 minutes and cost about $6.  Don't do it at a major brand name store.  They charge $15 and you may have to wait.

"Keeping this review as short as possible I'll try to be as objective as possible.

I purchased this watch from Amazon in 2006 and and had to change the battery six months ago. Still looks and works like new.

Pros:
Inexpensive quality time piece.
Very lightweight and hardly noticeable when on my wrist.
Tough titanium band/casing doesn't scratch or blemish.
Crystal still scratch free.
Extremely accurate never needs setting (unlike the clock in my Toyota).

Cons:
The stem for setting the time and date is smooth, small and difficult for me to use, especially when setting the date. The date window is so teeny I can't read it anyway so that's no biggie -  My iPhone, computer, and coffee cup have legible date & time displays.

Calendars, found on 99% of low-priced watches, it seems, are just something to fiddle with when the month has fewer than 31 days.  With this model Timex, I only have to change the time for daylight savings.  I can handle that.

"For years, men in my family who have worked in construction, steel mills, farming, etc. have chosen this watch because of its heavy-duty, industrial like quality.  These watches are simply perfect for heavy work. I've seen my father chip concrete off of his Timex watch and it being as good as new.  I've given countless Timex watches to my father, uncles and grandfathers and anticipate that I will continue to do so.

These watches are simple.  The only ""fancy"" extra is the addition of a button that the user can press to see the time at night.  The numbers are large so you don't have to squint to read them.  The second hand on the watch is very accurate making it possible to use the watch like a stop watch, if necessary.

The watches are waterproof -- they never steam up.  Wear them in the shower, in a rain storm or while swimming and they will emerge fine.

The watches do have limits and I have bought replacements when my father has broken the face or when he has worn the plating off of the band.  These situations have been maybe once or twice over the last decade.

This is a good, heavy-duty watch and is perfect for those who just need to know the time and, perhaps, require a watch that can withstand demanding work like construction.",Perfect for those who have demanding jobs and/or just want a simple watch,B00006I5XQ

Although his old watch still kept perfect time, the band broke (more like wore-out) and he replaced the band with an even more hideous band he found from an older watch, so I just had to get him a new watch. I had looked at getting him a more pricey, kinetic watch with lots of features and styling, but I know he just absolutely LOVES the Timex Indiglo feature and the expandable band, plus the easy-read dial is great for reading the time with his glasses off. I know he would not be happy with anything else but another Timex.",Nice watch,B00006I5XQ

"Lord, could Converse have got it any more right? One thinks not. The Converse All Star Chuck Taylor canvas shoes are everything one could need from a shoe and more. They are stylish, available in colours that vary from orange to pink, the more comtemporary leather versions, low cut and high cut. These baby's contour the foot so well,it's almost like walking on air! The canvas hugs the ankles, providing support...but the most important features of the shoes are that they are unisex (they look great on guys and girls) and they can be dressed down with jeans, or elegantly dressed up with a pair of tailored pants.

"When basketballer Charles ""Chuck"" Taylor walked into the Converse company back in 1921 complaining of sore feet, he started a revolution. He designed a shoe that was to bear his name only two years later. It would go on to be THE most popular sneaker of all time. Over 500 million pairs have been sold worldwide. The popularity of these legendary shoes has gone in waves but people have always come back to Chucks throughout the past 80 years! And some people, like myself, just can't get enough of them, and go on to build a collection of these wonderful sneakers. Nowadays I only wear Chucks, no other sneaker graces my feet. They are so comfortable and good looking, and take it from me, they boost your self-esteem! Walk down the street in them and you feel ten feet tall. Sounds corny, but it's true. They're like a security blanket around your ankles. I absolutely love Chucks and won't ever stop wearing them. Do yourself a favour, buy a pair. Then see how long till you get another and another.",The best sneakers on earth. Period.,B00006XXGO
"I was introduced to Converse All-Star's (Chuck's) two years ago and they are the best shoes I have ever owned.  Before I knew about Chuck's, I would have multiple pairs of sneakers for different activities, now I have one!

"I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security.",Best I've Ever Owned,B000074RL3
"Finally. I've tried so many sports bras since my chest bloomed cantaloupes, I've lost count. This is the one. I will never, ever buy another brand / model of sports bra.

Be advised, getting into it the first time will be a struggle. Do the bottom-most hook and eye first, then position the breasts into the cups, then continue. There's no other way to do it. This is a TIGHT bra. It has to be, to immobilize comfortably.

If this bra had been available when I was in High School, I might have actually learned to enjoy sports--and I might have ended up a lot less klutzy.

And I'm wearing it to work as a minimizer today.",I can jump up and down! Nothing moves!,B000074RL3

"This bra is so suportive and comfortable that, once accustomed to it, you won't want to ever wear a regular bra again.  It really lifts things where they should be and improves the fit of clothing.

"I bought my Enell about 4 months ago and it's been fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it. I used to have to wear 2 sports bras and even then I bounced and it HURT!

They do run very tight, but that's good because they get looser as you're exercising. At first I thought mine didn't fit because I was so squeezed in, but that just means that it fits perfectly. I can't say enough good about this bra.

"As an F cup I have been through MANY sports bras to find one that compresses, encapsulates and minimizes any bounce. I'm pleased to say that this more than meets my expectations. I have tried a few different ones since getting my first Enell but I keep coming back to this. If you want something designed for *high* impact then this should be your go to. This will take care of you while you do everything from burpees to jumping jacks to high knees. A lot of people do not like that the band can run tight but its designed to compress and support the breasts. I will grant you that they aren't the cutest design but if it worries you that much then throw a cute top on over it. You're there to work and this bra is there to support and protect you every step of the way while you do. Breast tissue is very delicate so don't risk injury or discomfort for the sake of looking good. You'll look and feel better being lean and fit without injuries. It is on the expensive end but consider it an investment that you won't regret. With proper care mine have lasted several years. Enell uses high quality material and its designed to last.

The picture almost scared me off, but I really really really wanted to find a 3/4 long line bra to wear, so I took a chance and ordered this one.  I am large chested, and my shoulders are started to get grooves from my traditional bras.  I wanted to find a everyday bra that provides a lot of support.  I tried the goddess long line bra, but it is more of a special occasion bra.

The sizing is very strange for this bra.  I normally wear a 36DD, but ordered a 38D, since no larger cup sizes are offered.  Was I ever shocked to find in this bra I would be considered a C cup.  I returned the 38D and believe the 38C will fit me great (I'm still waiting for it to arrive). When I tried on the 38D I couldn't believe how comfortable it was.

Only problem I know of is, after lots of wear (like every day for 5-6 mos.), the under wire has a tendency to pop out, right near the armpit. But I have gone so far as to sew the hole shut, just so I can continue wearing this lovely bra (until I can buy a new one, of course!)

I do not need the pockets, but they serve a useful purpose as a smooth lining which covers the dart seam in the bottom of the cup.  I measured using the instructions and sizing chart at amoena.com, which led me to purchase a larger size than I normally wear/measure.  In this larger size, the bra does not fit as well as I would like.  The band is slightly loose, while the cups are slightly tight, and the bra's overall length is a bit short.  It's OK to sleep in, but I would not use it for day wear.",Nice quality; strange fit,B0000862R1

This bra does not have enough support especially with the narrow straps and very hard to adjust the straps. The longline Bali bra was the best. I wore the Bali bra over 20 years.

"This is a wonderful solution for fuller figures, as the pointy shape provides a flattering look.  Anyone looking for a Mad Man figure should consider this piece of equipment.

My only complaint is that mine came mislabeled - I ordered 36 and got 38 with a paper tag that said 36.

Well, it worked anyway, and I was too lazy to return it.

"I've been trying to find a replacement for the Goddess 1304.  Thought I'd try this bra because it seems similar enough. I'm not too impressed. I don't think this is a bad bra. I just don't think it suits my needs.  Here's why:

I have back fat. I need to flatten said back fat. While it sort of did that, it created a whole new roll of back fat above the band. The band seemed be lower in the back. However, I compared it to my other bras and the band seems the same width and shape, so I don't know.  I didn't have the luxury of trying before I bought.  Admittedly, the issue might just be that I bought a size too small. Just mentioning it in case any other women with a similar body issue were thinking of purchasing. If you can, definitely try before you buy to make sure.

My main issue, however, is the straps. They just don't get tight enough. I shortened them as much as they would go, and it just wasn't enough.  I was visibly sagged in the front. If I can reach up and tighten straps with my hands and lift my girls, it's not a good thing. I didn't think it was very supportive. If you need a tighter strap to keep yourself up, I would not go with this bra.",Eh,B0000862B7
"Here are my likes:
-From the first moment I put this on my back felt a lot better!
-The girls are really ""UP THERE"", may take a little getting used to since they haven't been there in a while.
-Not restrictive,binding or pinching. Some side to side movements are out but that is the way all long lines or corsets are made.
-Not itchy.
-Spectacular Amazon shipping!
Here are my criticisms:
-The cups are a little outdated in style-Marilyn Monroe-ish and pointy, oh well, there are worse things to look like.
-Back closures require a second person to help you. If you live alone, you would want a front closure.",Love It!,B0000862B7

"Another Great Fantasie Bra! I've been wearing the 4510 and 4520 for about 20 years. They're the only Fantasie bras I'd ever worn. After breast reduction surgery I went from a 32F to a 32D. I thought that I'd try a different Fantasie bra and this one really delivers. Like the others, it has great support. It's true to size. I like how the straps angle in toward my neck a little which will allow me to wear tank tops in the summer without having my bra straps show. Some reviewers complained that the bra is a little revealing because the cup material isn't thick enough. So far I haven't noticed it. But, this is winter and I'm wearing lots of layers over the bra which is black. I'll probably know more about that in the summertime when I wear the tan bra with thinner tops. But if it's a problem I'll just buy the Nippies nipple covers from Amazon that some reviewers have bought. It sounds like the perfect solution.

"These were sealed in plastic and obviously brand new, so I was rather surprised that the fabric had a strong perfume scent.  After a wash and dry cycle, the scent persists.  It seems the manufacturer has determined that a deodorant was in order...?  Strange, given that we also got Jockey briefs for men another time and they were definitely not scented.  So wow.  Way to turn off fragrance-allergic customers.  I'm kind of surprised nobody else has mentioned the perfumy smell in the reviews, so maybe this was a new thing or one-off.  Possibly I could be convinced that a permanent scent could be miraculously imparted to the cloth through the plastic by accident.  Maybe.  But I'm not going to take the chance.  I'll stick with other  choices.

Update: Turns out there is at least one other review that warns of the scent.  I should have looked at all of them before buying! It truly didn't occur to me that they might be bathed in fragrance at the point of manufacture.

Update: 4/25/2014 - Just to update things, I've washed this underwear 5 or 6 times since I got it, and the scent is still strong.  It's just not fading.  They were so pretty and nicely constructed, I kept them, hoping the fragrance would go away, but now I see that wasn't a very bright idea.  I haven't been able to wear them after the first time and they are making the container they are stored in reek.  I think it's time to throw in the towel, so to speak.",Fabric is Scented,B00008ID0J

Very similar to many of the Ironman series from Timex. Smaller face. Chrono and Timer functions are easy to use. The water resistance to 100m is great. No worries about most water-related activities.

"I was looking for a digital watch that had a face that wouldn't catch on clothing, or anything else, and had a rubber (polyurethane) strap that wouldn't absorb smelly sweat after I went running. This Ironman has fulfilled both of those needs. Unlike my previous digital watch, this face is mid sized and does not snag on the wrists of jackets or on the carrying straps of book bags. The polyurethane wrist strap  is smooth on the skin, doesn't absorb sweat, easy to rinse, and durable. The indiglo light is bright and the watch is easy to read. The watch's features include: two time zone clock, with options for a 12 or 24 hour time keeping; alarm; a stop watch with splits and 30 lap memory; and a count down clock. All of which are simple and intuitive to program.

Also for men if you have typical belly, you can expect the waist band to roll down, but still it isn't binding.  Leg and waist elastic is very stretchy and non binding.  They wear like iron wash after wash, and retain their size.  I especially like the pretty print patterns.

The lack of stretch meant that this extra material pooled at my ankles in wrinkles.  No amount of pulling them up corrected this problem for very long.

"History/Experience:
I have struggled to find a good sports bra for my large chest since I was in middle school. Growing up playing soccer really made it hard to adjust when things started bouncing more. My mom (being smaller busted) also struggled to help me find a solution. Keep in mind, this was before the internet/google/amazon days. I finally settled on ""doubling-up"" when getting ready for a game or practice - which was a daily occurrence. Looking back now, that was terrible. I could barely breath correctly, getting in and out of two very tight bras was a nightmare not to mention quite embarrassing.  So, playing soccer ended soon after I became more full-figured.

Recently (at age 23) I started running, having my new sports bra from the sporting store, made ""specifically for larger breasts"". Well, that was a crock. Sorry, but bras off the shelf just don't cut it. After researching and reading about several of the newer sports bras on the market, I decided upon the Enell. I was careful not to get my hopes up too much however, because I didn't I could ever wear something that truly cut out the bouncing, but I remained hopeful. I measured, remeasured and finally ordered my new bra. As soon as it came, I had to go run around the neighborhood to give it a try. Oh, the joy of running!

The Real Product Review:
I am VERY HAPPY with the Enell. I can finally jog/run and truly enjoy what the sport has to offer, without worrying about hurting myself or being out of breath from non-stop chest thumping! The bra is quite tight but I think that is a necessity. I still move a little bit but since my breasts are held very close/tight to my chest, the up and down motion is very minimal. It took a few days of getting used to but now I love putting on my Enell (I always lay down to hook the clasps - much easier!) I love the tight feeling across my back when I am wearing it. I have even worn it all day at the zoo and other family activities. So easy, so comfy and SO worth every penny. The greatest thing, I don't have think twice when chasing the toddler! I don't have to worry anymore about wanting to enjoy an impromptu game of frisbee or catch at the park. I can run and play with the kiddos comfortably and confidently.

I would recommend the Enell to anyone with a larger bust that is tired of having to deal with improper support, doubling-up and not being able to breath, having constant chest-thumping when exercising, or just wants to feel better when playing with their kids. It has truly become one of my most essential pieces of clothing. As for the price: Yes, it seems expensive for a sports bra, but seriously, how much did you pay for your gym sneakers? I believe that this is just as essential to your workout wardrobe as your shoes. Maybe more since there are plenty of things you can do barefooted! Try it, feel the difference, find your stride, and go for it. You will be amazed at the difference proper support makes on your entire workout, attitude, and confidence! I have been using this bra for over 4 months now and still love it.

Note: I launder my bra in a lingerie bag (to wash and dry). It keeps other clothing from getting tangled in the clasps and ripping them out. This is a good trick for all of your bras since the larger size you need, the more expensive  they are! Also, I dry mine in the dryer since that helps to ""shrink it back up"" after use. So far, I have never had a problem and I'd say I have washed it well over 100 times using the lingerie bag.",A true lifesaver!,B000093AIC
"I have large breasts, larger than some but not the largest, 40 DDD. This bra did not even pass the bounce test. I put it on and jumped up and down. FAIL. I like to run and do Turbo Jam and even Zumba, but with the way this bra is I doubt it would have even held up to my Zumba classes. Back to the drawing board. Does anyone know of any great support/sprt bras out there?!",Does not work as intended,B000093AIC
"I like being active and find that there are very few sport bras that work to minimize the bust, reduce the bounce and support a large bust. Also, it shapes the bust so you don't look like you have ""uni-boob"" like some of the other sports bras. Enell fits perfectly and is perfect for intense cardio like walking, running, cross training and biking. When I hook into the bra (there are many hook and eyes), I feel like I'm locking myself into equipment but it allows me to be comfortable while working out. No more 2 bras or bra plus snug sport tank top. I don't wear this bra when I'm doing yoga or pilates because the compression makes it harder for me to breathe in this bra. Overall, great bra and very durable after many washings.",This is THE sports bra!,B000093AIC
"I was impressed with this bra. It has enabled me to exercise more freely without being worried about my breast excessively bouncing around and having to constantly readjust my bra. Even though I like this bra, I only gave it three stars because it appears that I am in between sizes. Initially, I ordered a size four which fit fine but it was a little loose and wasn't quite as supportive as I would have liked it to be. I still had a little bounce while exercising.  Despite the slight bounce, this bra did provide a lot more support than the average sports bra. I exchanged the size 4 for a size 3. The size 3 was perfect as far as being supportive and eliminating bounce while exercising. However, my breasts tend to spill out a little at the top which meant I constantly had to stop in the middle of my workout to readjust my bra.  If they made a size 3 1/2 I would have the perfect fit. Despite my sizing issue, I highly recommend this bra.  It is by far the best sports bra that I have used.  I purchased another one because I liked it so much.

Update July 2014:  I purchased this bra two years ago.  I originally only gave it three stars, but after two years I have to say that this is definitely the best sports bra that I have ever owned.  It is also the longest lasting bra that I have owned too.  I can't believe that it has held up so well after two years.  I work out on average 3 to 4 days a week and this sports bra has stood the test of time.  Purchasing this sports bra was definitely a good investment.",Good Bra,B000093AIC
"I've got to say that for the money this bra is kinda meh.  There's no adjustment for the shoulder straps and the support is just ok, not bad, but not really all that great.  Putting it on and taking it off is not too much work, the bra is not uncomfortable, but overall I'm not that impressed.",Enell is just ok,B000093AIC
"I bought my first Enell sports bra over 10 years ago based on a recommendation from a friend.  I am just now having to replace it!  Finally after all of these years one of the eyehooks has come loose and it is starting to look a little ragged, but still functions!  I just bought a new one and am pleased to find that the quality appears to be the same as the first.

I am a 42D and like to exercise - going to the gym, and doing CrossFit-style exercise.  I have tried conventional sports bras, even doing the double-bra thing and nothing works like Enell.  It takes a little getting used to at first and almost feels too tight, but it supports and holds like nothing else.  I can do jumping jacks, jogging, running - and it is not uncomfortable at all!  I won't say there is zero movement or bounce, but it is so minimal it is almost unnoticable.

"Boots were about one width size smaller than expected. Maybe it's because my 26 year old old boots had stretched a bit more, but I think the size was not as marked on one of the boots.

"Having wide feet and wanting high quality leather boots, preferably not in a neon colour, this is the way to go.

Over the last 15 or so years I have worn nothing but Puma King Top shoes. The lightweight high quality kangaroo leather is (in my opinion) a lot better than the lightweight plastic shoes that you see everywhere.
I like the fit, as I have wide feet, and these nicely stretch like thin leather boots should. I normally buy them half a size small, so within a couple of games they fit like a sock.

No problems with blisters, and the sole is just sturdy enough to prevent bone bruising in the ball of the foot even when playing on rock solid soil in the south.
These boots typically last me a calendar year or more, and seeing that I play on them at least 4 times a week, sometimes for 5 hours at a time, it is very impressive.

The only negative that I've encountered is that the stitching of the very tip of the boot tends to get damaged, and therefore can lead to the sole letting go. This normally is the last bit of life I am squeezing out of an old pair, and that is honestly the only problem I have encountered. Seeing as a lot of my team mates end up having to tape the front of their boots together, it seems to be a problem that happens with high end leather as well as the newer synthetic boots they sell a lot.

So, for any weather or surface, got get some of these, you will not regret it!",Will wear this boot as long as they keep making it,B00009PO42

I found the shoes too heavy for tennis.  The cover over the laces made it difficult to pull the laces tight.  I cut off the cover and that made it better. The advertisement on the back of one of the shoes came off which wasn't a functional part of the shoe so it didn't matter.  The strip is still on the other shoe. I wouldn't buy this shoe style again.

"Thank you K-Swiss for making this shoe for decades.  I remember wanting a pair in the 1970's and now my kids are wearing them.  My children's school has a dress code with all white tennis shoes, which are hard to find.  In addition, I have tried to buy cheaper shoes and have ended up replacing them every 1-2 weeks - I'm not sure how my kids destroy them but it's downright frightening to my wallet.  So I invested in the K-Swiss and have not been sorry.  I literally bought 7 pairs of other shoes between September and December, then bought the K-Swiss and they lasted for over a year until my daughter grew out of them.  I do recommend printing out the size chart and making sure you get the right size.",Solid and Kid-Proof,B0000A50X8

"Bought these based on some reviews that claimed this shoe to be a close replacement for the NB804/6, not even close as far as my fit is concerned.  Yes I am one of those also disappointed with what the other company did with my favorite shoe and am looking for a replacement.
1st off, K-Swiss does not seem to make different widths so if you have very wide feet, you are out of luck. Major differences are the Ultrascendor has a much higher arch and only offers a normal width (narrower) toe area, the heel height is higher from the ground and there is less ankle clearance - meaning the foot sits deeper in the shoe or the sides come up further towards the ankle.  So overall, this is quite a different fitting and feeling shoe from the NB804/6 series, and I would not call this an equivalent alternate.  However, by no means is it bad shoe, it is just quite different.
Now the good part: it is a stiffer shoe that does provide additional stability over the NB804/6 series even though it places the heel higher up off the ground.  The grip vs wear also seems to favor longer lasting wear though grip on the hard courts that I play on has never been an issue.  The shoe does feel bulkier with more padding in the uppers and the heel cup can rub the back of the achilles slightly.  I do not feel that the heel reinforcement is as strong as the NB804/6 series since it does not have that hard heel cup, so I would suggest not to slip on the shoes without undoing the laces first as this one is easier to collapse.
It took me about 90 minutes to adjust to this shoe before it faded into the background and I no longer thought about it.  So from a replacement point of view, it is not a direct replacement for the NB804/6, but I would re-order this shoe in a 1/2 size larger next time.  Construction and quality wise, it is as good as the NB804/6, the lower price seals the deal.  I've been converted.","Very different from the NB804/6 series, but I've been converted",B0000A52UF
"It's the first time when I bought this type of shoe, but I'm telling you, I love it; comfortable, cool, nice, I can't take eyes off them;  Yes I'm talking about ""CONVERSE"" by Chuck Taylor, baby.",Chuck rullz,B0000A6XS9
"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.

Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.

At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.

Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.

I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.

I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers.",Five Star All Stars,B0000A6XS9

Anyone who has owned a pair can tell the difference immediately. I will go down to the store and spend the extra $10 to get an authentic pair. The pictures of the black boot are the same size and style from a authorized Timberland dealer. While they are decent looking fakes, there are several flaws in the way they were made.

I have been very happy with it and I would definitely recommend it if it's the right kind of replacement watch strap for your sports watch.",Standard Watch Strap,B0000C0SE2

"My fiance gave me this watch for my birthday.  She knows I don't always like wearing watches, but she took a chance that I'd like the looks and the comfort of this one.  And she was right!

As was mentioned earlier, the clasp is the only downside to this watch.  But it's also a big plus.  Here's why...

The latching mechanism itself can be difficult to close (which is why I held back one star in my rating), but it's design also allows for infinite adjustment settings.  No longer are you locked into a preset number of sizes based on where the manufacturer drilled holes.  This band has a sliding adjustment that can be set ANYWHERE.  And you can do it without the aid of a jeweler.

The style is sleek, clean and definately modern.  I too get compliments at work on the watch.",Danish Modern design for your wrist,B0000C9ZBS
"The Skagen Men's Stainless Steel Watch w/Steel Mesh Band is the second of two Skagen watches added to my husband's watch collection. He appreciates the sleek light weight style, as well as its portability for travel in comparison to other bulky watches. The Skagen Stainless Steel is versatile and can be worn as a dress up or down accessory. I highly recommend the Skagen Stainless Steel Watch to anyone looking to purchase a comfortable economical time piece!",Timeless,B0000C9ZBS
"I have owned this watch for almost 7 years. Only in January of this year did the battery require replacement. I regularly get compliments from people passing by.  It is slim, durable, and has great design aesthetics.  I highly recommend this watch !!!",Wonderful watch for over 6 years.,B0000C9ZBS
"Besides the styling, which you can decide for yourself based on the picture,

What I like about this watch is:

1) It is a nice size for someone with a smaller wrist- if a larger watch looks ridiculously clunky on your wrist this will more likely work for you.

2) It has held up remarkably well- I tend to run into doors and walls absentmindedly and have 3 or 4 broken watches to show for it. It's also possible (but unlikely) that I haven't run into anything recently.

3) The links don't chafe your skin like watches with this style band occasionally do.

What I don't like about this watch:

1) I occasionally have a hard time with the clasp when I take it off; if you have arthritis it will be more difficult to take off.  It will also come flying off occasionally and hit the ground (see item 2 in what I like about the watch)

2) The clasp is too much fun to open and close- It will also fly off when I absentmindedly open and close it.

It's also fairly distinctive; I've gotten several comments about it and even one offer to buy it. How about 10 bucks for it?, I was asked. (I said no)

You can make your own decision if that's a positive or negative.",Very nice watch,B0000C9ZBS
"This watch is the best watch I have ever owned, no questions asked.  It is so thin and so light you can barely even tell something is on your wrist.  Many times I have to check to see if I'm wearing it or not because I don't feel it.  I love the mesh band, it never scratches because it's mesh! The domed crystal is next to impossible to scratch, not like any other watch i've had. I have made several small nicks on the brushed steel casing and I have simply rubbed the steel with the scratchy side of a sponge very lightly (with the grain of the metal so to speak) and it has completely removed them from sight without leaving scratch marks. The clasp on the band is great too, it slides to adjust where u want it, and it has dual locking mechanisms so that it will never fall off your arm even if you hit it on something really hard. I wear this watch for everyday use, it's elegant and yet simple.  I get more compliments on this watch than any other accessory I wear. It also comes with a 5 year skagen warranty so rest assured it will be taken care of. Great price for a great watch, Buy it!",Perfection!,B0000C9ZBS

"I did a fair amount of research before I purchased this watch and for the price, it is hard to do better.  The mesh band looks professional and the fold over clasp is very secure.  Like most metal bands you are at risk of losing a few hairs; however, much less than most.  The watch is lightweight but durable (I have already smacked it against a door jam).  The watch is also very quiet (I can only hear the ticking when the watch is up against my ear).  The only thing I do not like about the watch is the date is small and hard to read.  However, I still rated the watch a five based on its other attributes.",Great Watch for the Price,B0000C9ZCQ

"This Skagen Watch is light on the wrist easy to clasp and great looking!
Its manufactured with slim tech in mind and fine craftmanship.  The case
is unique of stainless steel unibody construction. The band is stainless

date window, real small but overall it doesn't deter from my purchase.

Amazon is amazing with price and tracking,couldnt be beat! THANKS",clearboy65,B0000C9ZCQ
Sleek dark face with pin dot dial markers make it easy to read time while keeping the face classy. No numbers except the date which is small but good enough to help. Thin body and band are a great alternative to heavy thick watches. The band is not difficult to latch once you get used to it. The watch is a steal. Comes with a battery.,Sleek look yet very easy to read.,B0000C9ZCQ
"In the price range, skagen undoubtedly has the nicest watch designs I've seen but unfortunately it's not enough to overcome the problems they have designing functional bands. In less than a year, I paid twice to have broken pins repaired and then gave up when the mesh came unattached from the pin connection and the watch would have needed repair a third time.
I know the watch comes with a warranty I didn't take advantage of, but this is an irrelevant point to me. To warranty the watch, I would have had to pay $8.95 to skagen in addition to paying shipping and wait weeks for the watch to come back. What good is that? If I was a ""good customer"" and followed skagen's procedures, I would have paid at least $40 on top of the price of the watch, within a year, just to keep it functioning. I take very good care of my watches and didn't wear this on a daily basis either, it simply has an awfully designed pin assembly. About the same time I bought this watch, I got a skagen as a gift for my girlfriend and to no surprise, it has had the same problems. I just love giving gifts that I have to regularily take to be repaired....","Great watch, awful band",B0000C9ZCQ
"I am very happy with the purchase of this watch.  After reading some of the other reviews I was a little worried about the difficulty in operating the bracelet latch and the possiblility of the glass face shattering in cold weather that others had reported.  However, This watched has now survived nearly a week of sub-freezing temperatures and there's no problems with the glass.  Also, the bracelet latch is unique in how it works, but I wouldn't call it confusing.",very satisfied,B0000C9ZCQ

Had been looking for this watch for over one year.  Went online and there it was.  Amazon was great and received watch in three business days.  Will do business again and would highly recommend.,Great find,B0000C9ZBQ
"Very pleased.  This watch is stylish, moderately dressy, looks more expensive than it is.  Very lightweight and mesh band is soft and comfortable, easy to forget you have it on.  Quite thin at 5 mm, adding to the tastefulness.  One reviewer of the mesh bracelet said it snags; I don't find that at all.  Watch case is polished steel, not brushed; it might scratch/dull unevenly over time but that's hard to predict.  Not a lot of contrast between face background (a kind of oyster-white) and the goldtone stick time markers on the face, so buyers with poor eyesight should be aware of that.  No second hand, but it's a dress watch.  Overall, very impressive for the money.",high value,B0000C9ZBQ
"It would be hard to find a classier watch.  A few things to consider, though, before buying.  The picture of the watch sold for $58.99 by Watchsavings on Amazon is not quite accurate.  That picture appears to show black hands and markings and a black ring around the watch face.  The one I received (which is still beautiful) is gold accents only, no black at all. [Note: the other pages offering this same model watch by other sellers for higher prices DO depict the watch accurately.] If this is what you want, great.  If you're getting far-sighted with the passage of years, though, the reduced contrast between gold and the white face will have you peering momentarily to read the hands. Not a major gripe, but some may be bothered more than I.  Also, don't overlook that it has no second hand.  Having said all this, I still think it's a gorgeous watch and it's my second Skagen.  Will probably get more.","Elegant, but be aware of some features.",B0000C9ZBQ

It also keeps excellent time.  The only thing I do not like is the clasp.  It's a little difficult to put on and the bottom tends to get scratched and, sometimes, caught on things.  It has also come loose a couple of times, and I do not find it easy to tighten.

In all, I like the watch but if I bought it again I'd look for a regular clasp.",Like Everything But The Clasp,B0000C9ZBX
"This is a terrific watch! It's incredibly thin, looks great, and keeps reliable time. I've had it for about a year and haven't had a single problem.
The band may be the best part.  Leather bands deteriorate over time; expandable bands can be uncomfortable (and can catch the hairs on your arm); and traditional metal bands often require a trip to a jeweler to add or remove links.  But the thin, light, adjustable metal band on this watch is fantastic. It grips firmly and is easily adjusted.

However, the crystal cracked while I was wearing it. No hard impact or anything, I was just loading a suitcase into my car. this was probably the 10th time that I have worn this watch.

I'll probaby send it in to get the crystal fixed, but the next watch I buy will have higher quality, more scratch/crack resistant face.","Great watch, but the face cracked with normal use",B0000C9ZBX

"i suggest avoiding this watch, and others of this brand.  my uploaded photo shows one i bought in 2013 (left, with no glass) and another one purchased october 2014.  when the crystal (glass) cracked on the first one i assumed i had caused an impact.  i did like the watch, so i bought another.  eight months later the crystal cracks on the new one while i am strenuously sitting at my work desk.  this is too bad, as i think this is a stylish but non-gaudy watch.  they seem to self destruct for no obvious reason.  please note: after the crystal cracked in my first one, i was very careful with the new one.  skagen gets one star for two reasons: one, that's the lowest rating allowed.  two: the older one without a crystal has actually kept pretty good time, so the movement of the watch earns the single star by itself.",automated self destruct function that really works,B0000C9ZBX

"This watch is great - as have all my Skagen watches been.  It is beautiful to look at, light weight, and a good size.  The only negative about this is that Skagen has started to move to the fine mesh bands.  Having not owned one of them before, I didn't realize that unless you have the band just at the right size the mesh will pull at the hair on your wrist (no matter how little).  Were it not for this I would give it a five.  So spend a few minutes sizing the band just right and you won't have a problem and you'll have a watch that catches your eye as well as others.",Another Great Skagen Watch,B0000C9ZDM

"I loved this watch. It looks cool, it's weightless on, it seemed durable, and I've recieved a bunch of compliments. The problem that I've had is that the crystal broke without provocation. I never hit it on anything or dropped the watch, I just woke up one day and it had two big cracks that run through the center of the face. I have had this watch for less than 3 months. To make it worse I had another one just like it right before this one and the same thing happened in less than two weeks. I thought that the first was a lemon or something and liked everything about the watch, except what had happened, so I choose an even exchange. Wrong choice. The titanium is strong, but the crystal is week. My advice is: DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH. don't be charmed by its style or seemingly strong construction. I should also say that I've gone back to the swatch that I've had for about 6 years now, which has never had any problems. i mention this only to compair the durability of crystals in the two products and to note that the crystal cracked during normal use, not agrivated.",poor construction,B0000C9ZDM
"Selecting Skagen, I thought I was buying a quality watch... Far from that.

It may look beautiful, but in a week or so after you start wearing it, its black polish starts to fade, leaving awful white patches.. What is more, the little 'mails' that compose the mesh have began to loosen on the creases...The closing mechanism is so badly designed, that the watch spontaneusly falls off from the hand all the time.

"Pro: It's a sleeky watch with a reasonable price.

Con: The mesh band is by no means ""easily adjustable."" Once you have lifted up the clasp, you cannot snap it closed, at least not without a screwdriver and a hammer.

Had the watch for two weeks now and love it, especially the thin design, which helps me when I am typing on my MacBook Pro laptop -- it doesn't hit the metal ledge like my other Skagen watch, which was thin, but not this thin. My only disappointment was the clasp and the reason for the one star deduction. It's needs precision to get it closed, rather a light touch, but I'm sure I will get used to it.

I've curtailed buying from Amazon until I'm convinced they won't be doing this any more.

I have always loved these shoes. This was a great deal on a hard to find color. I shopped around everywhere that I could think of and couldn't find a better price. I will definitely buy these from Amazon again.,Love Chuck Taylors,B0000CFJY7
The last time I had a pair of these i was in the fourth grade and they cost about seven dollars.  I remember because they fell apart fairly quickly and my father chewed me out for ruining a seven dollar pair of shoes.  Well now they're about 33 dollars a pair and I'm almost 49 and I suspect I'll take better care of my Chucks this time...,Retro to the fourth grade...,B0000CFJY7
These are exactly what I was expecting. Simple shoes that seem to have a quality construction. I have worn them most days of the last two weeks and nothing wrong yet. I will update if I feel like they break too soon. A common fault of shoes like this is for the sole to separate from the shoe where your toes meet your foot. The regular stress and bending can wear them out quickly.,Quite nice,B0000CFJY7

"This is one of the most comfortable shoes or sandal I have ever owned. I first saw these on some ultralight backpackers I met in 2005, and they swore by them for comfort and strong enough to climb rough terrain. For a sandal, that just blew me away. I confess I have not used them to backpack, but I have used them on rough terrain and they are outstanding and amazingly ""grippy"". It has little nubs on the carbon outer sole that dig into or grip everything.
SIZING:  I have read that most people find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoes, and that was my experience as well.
COMFORT: Tremendous arch support. The sandal has a wide toebox so that your toes are not cramped together, and the protective toe guard is great. I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these, plus I can hide my ugly toes. It also has a little rise on the rear heel that cups your heel comfortably, but helps protect you against those people that step on the back of your foot in line. The sandal feels very secure once it is on and does not slip. There are no straps to fool with or Velcro to adjust, it has an inner lining that looks like the neoprene on a scuba suit, it stretches to fit. The rear strap does not hurt your foot. It has a no lace closure and you set it once, from then on it slips on easy. The footbed cradles my foot like no shoe I have ever seen. There is a little ridge on the inner sole that runs behind the toes and then in between your big toe and other toes, it turns out to add to the comfort of the shoe immensely. That ridge forms in a short time to your foot, giving you your own custom fit. With these shoes I find i can stand longer and walk longer.
GRIP AND TRACTION: It has an anatomical outer sole that is very grippy, with a nice athletic shape, it gives good traction on sand, rock, mud, you name it. It is not slippery on wet surfaces like the dock, and the sole does not leave any marks on floors. The tread does not hold dirt in any grooves to track indoors. It is great for water use, and can be completely submerged with no damage. If it gets wet,the material that wicks the water away fast.
ODOR: It has an anti-microbial treatment that takes away any germs, I do not know how long that treatment lasts though. They do not get sweaty or smelly like my Crocs do.
DURABILITY: I got my money's worth out of them for sure. When my H2's get dirty, I throw them in the sink, under the hose, or even in the washer and they come out like new. I wore these almost daily for 4 months straight with no evidence of wear. It has now been 4 years and I still use them more than any other shoe in the summer. I hope they are still made as durable as they were when I bought mine. This includes vacation, in which I am standing in line all day at theme parks and scrambling at the beach. These come in many colors. For a dressier sandal I also like the brown Dunham Moose Fisherman (actually designed by New Balance). These sandals were good enough to get me to buy two tennis shoes from the same company in the last 4 years, an in-town shoe called Austin and an ugly hiker called the Targhee II. In the end, I just can't say enough about these shoes, I highly recommend.",Best comfort and durability I have ever seen in a sandal,B0000DYKET
"Even though these shoes are a bit expensive, I have never purchased a more comfortable or durable pair of shoes. Tough as nails. I have been using mine on a daily bassis for the past 18 months. I walk atleast 5 miles a day. Still holding up perfectly except for normal wear.",100 Dollars well spent,B0000DYKET
I bought a pair and have not taken them off since. Easy to slip on and off these are the perfect pair for someone on the go. The unique toe guard protects your feet like no other sandal of this type. They also dry very quickly so if you spend a lot of time around water these could be the sandals for you. (Although the Newport H2's dry faster) To top it all off they feel great on my feet. Do yourself a favor and try these out you will not regret it.,Great Sandals,B0000DYKET
Fits well. Very comfortable.,Very comfortable.,B0000DYKET
"This was my 3rd pair of this same model over the last dozen or so years.  My first pair are still usable but the sole has been worn smooth.  My last pair are still doing ok, but one of the leather straps is separating from the sole.  For 8 years of good service, that's just fine.

The uppers on the new pair seem just a little snug, but the sole is just right for my size.  I actually like having the elastic uppers being snug since I know they will [and already have] loosen up.

These are my favorite footwear from May to October for outside use, and well beyond for inside use.  They last a long time, are comfortable, look great and are a great value for the cost.

I'm a loyal and happy customer.  Recommended buy for sure.","These are durable, comfortable, attractive and affordable sandals for everyday use [and beyond]",B0000DYKET

"I have been buying only Keen Targhee boots and Newport Sandals for 12+ years, and have owned several pairs of each - even though expensive, they are great quality and the most comfortable footwear I have found to date, especially if you have wide feet. I just got a new pair of these last fall, and they do not feel like the former pairs that I have owned - they do not seem to have the same arch support, and they make my feet hurt, given that I am on my feet much of the day. I am really disappointed, and am going to be trying the very similar Teva sandals now, which are not only less expensive, but are the best rated, so I hope they have been support.",wish I could return these because I cannot wear them & a lot of cash to lose - they are barely used,B0000DYKET

Because of that, it's not comfortable at all. In hindsight, I wish I stuck with the Newport H2 Sandal.",Not as comfortable as Newport H2,B0000DYKET

"These are the most confortable socks. However I bought these 'heavy crew' for a week long backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon thinking they'd be more cushiony when ive been using the lighter weight Smart Wool socks and had broken in my boots with the lighter socks. These will work well for people who are used to thicker socks or with my mountaineering boots. It was a mistake on my part to get the new heavy crews for the first time on a long trip ... but after my trip and a blister on my arch from the friction of a thicker sock than I'm used to, I been wearing these around like slipper socks or with my crocs. So comfy. I'm sticking with the lighter weight smart wool socks for my regular hiking boots. But it was my mistake so not sure it's fair to lower a point, especially when these socks are so comfortable for other uses I don't regret buying them now that my trip is over and im using them for other things other than with my regular hiking boots.

Power and flexibility with every kick, very handy fins to put on in a crowded

"5 stars. This shoe has an amazing heel - I guess made from some sort of gel/carbon. For a heel striker like me, the landing feels rock solid and stable. Then the outsole under the carbon/gel heel is carbon rubber, and you can feel the traction working well.

Other highlights:
Very good cushioning all through the midsole.
Good snug - but not tight - fit around the foot.
Good quality upper, with a mix of fabric and I'm guessing synthetic leather...looks nice too.
Works well for a neutral/underpronater/supinator like me.

"I was very disappointed in this shoe.  I had last year's model of this shoe and loved it.  It was very supportive and I did a lot of running in them.  As expected, they wore out  over time so I got this newer model a month ago.  I hate them.  Someone mentioned the oversized tongue and that was the first thing I felt when putting them on.  They are no where as supportive as the older model.  If you compare the two there is at least 1/4 inch less arch support.  This new sneaker has an insert inside rather than the shoe itself being as supportive.  I had shin splints the first week of running in these, which indicated I was using new muscles due to different support.  They squeak and have some sort of leak as I see condensation in the ""air bubble"" on the bottom of the shoe.  They are attractive and comfortable if you are just going to walk around in them and use them for fashion, but if you have flat feet and run, I would not recommend these.  I actually just bought the old model on clearance here online and wish I did that to start as I would have saved myself $120, but the new ones were much better looking and not so much like grandma's orthotic shoe.",Not as supportive as last year's model,B0000DZA4T

Some of the other firm supports were too rigid.  In the entire time of wearing my old ones, I never had any blisters or calluses. They are still in decent condition and the exterior leather has lasted, as well as the soles.  My primary reason for replacement for running is that I could tell they had gotten worn out in the support, however, I'm still using them as a cross-trainer.

"I got these on a bit of a whim, needing more workout shorts but tired of all bike shorts all the time.  I'm pleased enough that I'll probably pick up another pair.

Good length - not down to the knees, but not so high the thighs chafe.  Good fabric thickness - thin enough to stay fairly cool while exercising in the hot, humid summer in Houston, but thick enough to not show off the color of my undies.  It is a bit thicker and warmer than my bike shorts, but not so much as regular sweatpant material would be.

The dropped-look wide waistband is flattering, and there's a drawstring about an inch down that can be tied if you're doing something extra-energetic and are afraid the shorts might slip or be pulled down.  They're a little snug on the top, but not so much as bike shorts.  The bottoms are a little loose, but not so much that they ride up much, if at all.

"My husband is very particular about his hunting and fishing gear so for him to say something positive about these wader boots is a real compliment . He says the fit is just perfect...and don't ask me why but he says he feels sexy in these boots. He looks good too, don't know how sexy he looks but I will say...he looks good .They are not bulky or klutzie either, fit really nice and comfortable.
He uses them a lot to work on the pond to break the ice  so the geese can get in the water to warm up. Keep in mind when it is below zero outside, if they can access water, the water will be above freezing and they will make entry the minute he is done breaking up the ice to get warmed up. .

"I was a die-hard fan of the original Jazz running shoe until it became a ""sneaker."" The original Jazz eventually morphed into a cheapy senior-look leisure shoe...the indignity!  Why was that ever allowed to happen? I should have bought two dozen pairs way-back-when when I found that I liked the fit, comfort, stability and durability of the Jazz and later Jazz Grid.

I fast-walk 4 miles daily M-F on a university track and have been doing so since the early '80s so I know which shoe of those I've tried over the years delivers what I want/need in a running shoe. After the demise of the Jazz-as-I-knew-it and years of pinched toes/blackened toe nails, quickly worn-out outsoles from Adidas et al, it took me awhile to rediscovered the curved last, generous toe area and narrow heel area of the Jazz in the Hurricane 11 Progrid running shoe. Fit and comfort at last. Should buy a dozen before these morph...

Not crazy about the look though--that segmented bulbous heel...Not attractive. And the over-the-top visual busyness of the shoe top. How about a more minimalist, stream-lined look? Also, do wish Saucony would come out with REAL COLORS other than the boring whites w/ baby blue or other pastel accents they offer.

"I use the amazing Miura (lace-up) exclusively. I've had 5.10 before, and tried on 11 other pairs (Evolv, Scarpa, etc.) before settling on these. I was holding off due to the price, and ended up wasting an hour fooling with inferior designs and lower-quality materials when I should have just gone with these to begin with. I bought my first pair four years ago and haven't found anything better. I own two pairs now, and alternate depending on what I'm doing.

Pros
* Superb fit: the arch, heel and tongue shrinkwrap to my foot, and I essentially forget I'm wearing climbing shoes
* Sensitivity is fine. There's no searching for the jib or cleft
* Protection is great. I can point, hook and edge all day with no concerns
* Lacing system, though a bit odd at first, is fast, easy, and hasn't blown out an eyelet or lace path
* Laces seem to have some tougher material woven into them... they are tough and despite hundreds of lace-ups, they haven't frayed or snapped... they appear to be capable of enduring for the life of the shoe
* Edge rubber is firmer and the toe rubber is softer, like a bighorn sheep's hoof
* Lining holds up fine -- no pilling, tearing, moisture issues or general disintegration
* Rand is durable and despite a few wear spots, is holding up well with no blowouts or expanding holes
* Double heel loops to make fitting faster and reduce wear on a single loop. The loops are also offset so they don't rub the achilles' tendon
* Initial size is maintained throughout its life. I consider this a pro, while some might want some stretch. Just know that you're getting a lined shoe and it's going to stay true to size

Cons
* One of the most expensive climbing shoes... but ooh what you can do in it...
* The toebox is a bit big, even when my foot is at full downturn on a steep overhang. It doesn't bug me, but it does require exact sizing to minimize the bulk
* Smearing is.... OK. If you really like to toe-smear, look for something less downturned. These will probably change your style (I have seen this in my wear patterns across the two most recent pairs I own)
* When it gets wet, the heel can slip a bit, so I shake some foot powder in, before a session
* If you're a vegan, sorry... these are leather. Time to determine just how strong your resolve is... I did think about it, but given the feel of other shoes, compared to this perfect-for-me design, it was no contest

Other thoughts
My street shoe and hiking boot size is 10.5, which equates to a 44. I am most comfortable in a Miura 43, and can fit into 42.5 but they're tight enough to want to take them off during breaks. I feel that I can wear my 43s around for hours straight without feeling like I'll damage my toes, yet the shoes are perfectly ready to go, when i am. My 42.5s are reserved for use when the 43s go get resoled or are soaked, or I'm wanting optimum pointing and edging.

I can't wear La Sportiva's boots due to their characteristic narrowness, so I was surprised when these Miuras worked, and not just sort of worked, but more as if they were custom-made for me. I use these primarily on our indoor climbing wall, though I boulder on granite and sandstone in them as well. I can't make any recommendations for big-wall climbing in them, but given that Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell use them for that, well, I think that should fill in the blank.",Superb downturned all-arounder,B0000E678B
"Great climbing shoes. I've used these for the last 8 months and just had them 1/2 resoled with XSedge rubber.  Stick great to tiny edges, smearing, cracks, etc.",Great shoes,B0000E678B
"I had a pair of these years ago when I was climbing more regularly, and used them for years. They have great edging power, and the fit is very tight in all the right places without being such a squeeze that I can't keep them on for longer multi-pitch work. Some people have had problems with quick delaminating--I haven't experienced anything of the sort, but will keep an eye out for it on this pair.

Like others have suggested, get these a size or a size and a half below your street shoes. Ideally, try them out in person before buying online, and go for a fit that is as snug as comfortable--like all leather shoes, these will stretch.",I love these shoes,B0000E678B

"I'm really just breaking these in so this should not be considered a durability review. But these are the perfect shoe for an intermediate climber. I wanted to be able to climb past my ability as I look forward to progressing in my climbing, but I also wanted something that would fit my feet... not grind them into salsa! These shoes were the answer, I have been climbing for 3 years, I love these shoes, Hell no I wouldn't walk around the house in them, but they are awesome for a day at the gym!

Last week I sprained my ankle, when my fiance wanted to go climbing I said I should be able to belay her but I wasn't looking forward to actually using my foot... however when I got to the gym I wanted to get on the wall just to see how it felt. The support of the shoes were phenomenal... I ended up climbing a 5.10+ With no problem... Literally the shoes prevented me from realizing I had a sprained ankle!

Would recommend to any person who needs a good pair of shoes with performance and comfort in mind.

I do wish there was a bit more grippy rubber on the top of the toe but A+++ all the same!",LOVE THESE SHOES!!!,B0000E6703
i've been using these for about 2 months. and i've found that there better for bouldering because when you whereing these for awhile they don't provide alot of suport and your feet end up hurting for a few days.other than that they provide great grip. my most favorable shoes for overhang and compititions.,great for bouldering,B0000E6703
"Just outstanding. I climbed for 8 years in London's Westway Wall, 4 days a week, 3 hours a day. I tried maybe 5 different pairs of shoes in the early days until I hit on these. I hate laces, so love the velcro straps. I climbed 6C through the odd 7B and always felt the shoes were great. They grip anything well and are comfortable. Yes, if you overtighten them, the rear will dig into your Achilles a little. Also, the velro straps come a little long so I have to cut maybe 1 inch off each - but they are designed to be cut to length and the stitching doesn't come out.
To me they are the perfect mix of comfort and performance. Even after 200 outings, they still look ok and not too beat up.
The toes go first always for me - I think I am on my 7th pair. But they last plenty long enough and you feel these toeless old friends have paid their dues.
It's time to get my sons onto Lover's Leap in Tahoe where I live now, so I searched for these shoes and just bought 2 new pairs.
I have never written a review on Amazon ever, but decided these old faithfuls deserved a strong recommendation. Hope they make them forever. Hope I am able to climb forever! Peter H",La Sportiva Katana,B0000E6703

A good but less aggressive than the muiras.  You can size this for an all day shoe while still having solid ability to edge.  The toe box is not so down turned that you can't smear.

"These shoes got a lot of bad reviews for some reason. I haven't had them for too long so I can't make claims about the durability as of yet. Ill update later on that. however the quality is pretty nice; the only common issue I've had with some of the bad reviewers is that awkward extra heel space. I didn't like it at first but the extra heel space actually isn't as much of a burden as you might think, you just have to learn how to work with it and its actually quite comfortable.",These shoes got a lot of bad reviews for some reason,B0000E6703
"One point to note is that the actual EURO size to US size is incorrect. I purchased a 41.5 EURO which was a 8.5 US but La Sportiva sizes it as an 8 UK and 9 US. Compared to my size 8.5 FiveTen Gallileos, these 41.5 Katanas were truly a size 9 US. If you want to go a half to full size street shoe size lower, I suggest take a full size off from the Amazon chart. For a size 8 US, go to a 40 EURO for the Katanas.

Despite being my street shoe size, the Katanas are still a great shoe. They have a break-in period of roughly 2-3 days for me, bouldering for 4hrs from V0 to V5 routes. The rubber has a sheen that needs to be worn off, they will be very slippery initially on the wall but will begin to start sticking very well over time. Compared to my FiveTen Gallileos, these are narrower with better rubber and still just as comfortable. I wear a brace on my left ankle and it was able to accommodate the extra layer yet not be detrimental to how the shoe was positioned and fit. For heel and toe hooks, I've found these shoes to perform very well. I'm also able to catch smaller foot holds better and edge much more aggressively. A slight drawback is that they don't smear as well as my FiveTens. The velcro straps also feel thinner and more brittle.

Overall a great shoe which would have been even better if I had them in my desired size.",Stick it!,B0000E6703
"These are now my favorite shoe. Very comfortable, accurate and firm enough for the outdoors. My pythons are a great shoe for the indoors, but do not give enough support outdoors for smearing and edging.",These are now my favorite shoe. Very comfortable,B0000E6703
"I am a beginner climber, I do a lot of indoor and outdoor bouldering, and occasionaly top rope sport climbing.  I also have very narrow feet, so I tried on and purchased 6 different pairs of climbing shoes before I finally found one that fit my narrow feet well.

The rubber on these is confidence inspiring, and lets you stick to both indoor and outdoor rock walls with no problems.  The toe is pointed enough to get into small holes.  They are not super aggressive, but I would consider them an intermediate climbers shoe.

I wear a 10.5 in street shoes, and 42.5 fit me well.  42 for me was way too tight, but you definitely want to try on multiple sizes.

Overall great shoe, I will likely buy this same model again when I wear these out.","comfortable climbing shoe, grippy sole, good edging, fits narrow feet",B0000E6703
"Not a bad solution to help fill out a bathing suit.  I would say that the area of the pad actually covers about 70% of the cup, providing a small amount of lift.

"The first thing to note is that the Timex web site claims a three-year battery life, while Amazon claims eight years.  I hope Amazon is right, but you should know what the manufacturer thinks ;)

My wife chose this watch because of its looks, and I must admit that it looks rather nice.  This is definately no-frills.  No compass, no alarm, no stopwatch.  But it tells the time and date.

Besides looking sharp, my favorite thing is the size/weight -- it is rather thin and light.  I wanted a watch with more features, but I could not stand the thought of something larger and heavier.

There is really not much to complain about.  The date display is rather small.  The band is also advertised as being ""water resistant leather"" but I would not want to take it swimming.  Only time will tell how it hold up.  I also do not know why watch manufacturers continue to use cheap zinc glow powder for the hands.  Newer strontium-based powders are available that still glow great after eight hours.  Oh well, all manufacturers do this, and it can light up the entire face so the glow powder is really not even needed.

So, to summarize, it is small and light for a metal men's watch, and it looks great.  Guys, one look at this and the ladies will know that you are a man who is comfortable in the deep woods.","Looks great, works great.",B0000TIISW

"Timex Women's Classic Cavatina Expansion Watch T21882:  I returned the watch, since I wanted a white watch face with real numbers.  The face was a pearl rather than a flat white.  The pearl background distorted the view of the numbers, since it reflected the light hitting the face of the watch.  I have had a Timex watch exactly like this one but with a flat white background on the face, so that is what I expected.  From the picture on the website it was impossible to see that the face was not what I wanted.  I have a small wrist and do not want a big watch, so the size is good.  And, I do not want to fight with putting the watch on my wrist, so the expansion band is perfect.

"This is a lovely watch. The expandable band is for a not large wrist. It is tight on me and tends to pinch, unfortunately. It was small for my friend too, so we're waiting for a friend with a smaller wrist to give it to.

"I've used this watch for basic training, under all conditions of weather.  Although it didn't last 2 years, I bought another one and took it to Iraq.  The alarm, stopwatch and indiglo became essential, as well as having two different times that can be toggled back and forth easily.

I found the controls simple and very managable.  I'm going back for a third one.  At this price, it can't really be beat.",Multifunctional and value-priced,B0000TIJ6S
"This is the 3rd or 4th model of this watch I have bought.  I was always an analog girl until about 8-9 years ago and I bought this watch - my first digital.  I was a runner and loved the chronograph, alarm, etc.  When it died, I bought another one just like it.  When it died, I bought another one.  Come to think of it, this is my 5th one!  The good news is that it is fairly cheap to replace.  The bad news is that it doesn't last too long.  However, I wear it in the shower, kayaking, snowboarding, diving, so it has definitely taken a beating.  Usually the battery dies, but on my last one the indiglo died.",I love this watch,B0000TIJ6S

"I have extremely small wrists, and was looking for a watch with an expansion band to replace one I had a few years ago which fit perfectly.  You won't find the dimensions of the watch anywhere - Timex support wrote me only that it will fit ""up to a 6-1/2"" wrist.""  The actual dimensions are:  watchband - 6"" x 1/4"" (3/8"" at widest end); face - 15/16"" x 11/16"".  A jeweler said he'll only charge about $5 to remove bands so that it fits, so that's good news.  The watch is okay - nothing special, larger than what I had hoped for, the face looks a little bulky to me, but it'll be fine.

"This is an attractive watch and not very expensive.  There is one odd thing about it, which is that the band is not as comfortable as I would like.  Rather sharp edged and also pinches at your arm hairs.  I am putting up with it, however. Of course, being a Timex, it keeps very good time.",Nice watch,B0000TII8C
I was very happy to find this watch online.  I wanted to replace the one I have with the exact same thing but couldn't find it in any store.  The watch is great but needs to be replaced occasionally because of the type of work I do the band tends to get discolored and stretched out after a couple of years.,watch,B0000TII8C

"I am not easy on anything I own. I usually purchase books used for this exact reason(why spend more if i'm going to kill it anyway). That being said, this has been on my wrist since, erm, well early 2000. So, well over eight years of daily (ab)use. Just a few months ago, I finally managed to scratch the crystal. And I am constantly walking into walls, come into a room *bam* right on the threshold. There is plenty of paint on the face which has to get fingernailed off every so ofter. And then there are the times I get the thing wet. 8 years of showers baths etc, 5 2 hour trips down the Little Miami River in a tube, countless hours of swimming(though that has backed off as of late ):  and WAY too many hours in dish water; nary a DROP of moisture inside this thing. And that is even after taking the back off about 5 times to change the battery. I did have to get a new watchband once. But, to my memory Timex sent me a new one for seven bucks shipping.

"I like this watch, overall.

Pros:

1. Crisp, clear face numbers.

2. Easy to set date/time.

Cons:

1. nylon band.

 I have  been used to a resin band (for over 10 years), so switching to nylon was immediately felt by me. The band seems scratchy to my skin. I suppose it will get better over time.

2. plastic watch face.

 It is raised, off the face of the watch, without protection, so it seems easily vulnerable to sratches.  And indeed, within 24 hours, a sratch has occured to the face. I'm not sure how over time this will play out.

 I can't tell if this is the same situation with the Timex Men's Camper Watch #T18581, which was the other watch I was considering to buy.","looks nice, but vulnerable cover and scratchy band",B0000TIIUK
"My husband is hard on watches; so, after buying him several expensive watches, I stopped and opted for inexpensive watches at discount stores.  Unfortunately, in many cases, you get what you pay for.  Not so with this Timex Camper Expedition.  It is worth more than the price.  It keeps good time; of course, that's required.  But in addition, the band is comfortable and indestructable.  On other cheap watches, the bands have been a problem as they crack or fall apart and then the pins make them difficult or impossible to replace.  This Timex has no pins to remove for band replacement.  So far, that's not an issue because the band has held up great.  Also, at age 62, some watch faces are difficult to read.  This face is clear and bold.  I would recommend it for anyone.",Great watch for the price,B0000TIIUK

"I've worn this watch every day for about five years, and I am buying an identical replacement because this is one of the best watches I have ever owned. Everybody I know compliments me on the attractiveness of the design, including the typeface of the numerals.

The watch is a bit fragile - I dropped it at airport security once and the back plate came off, but it's been tough enough, otherwise. If you are abusive, the lens will scratch. The case has held up fairly well - various nicks, scratches and scuffs are visible after five years, but only if you look closely. I recommend that you take the watch off when moving furniture, washing dishes, playing sports, etc. like an adult with common sense.

I replaced the battery once, but I accidentally lost one of the tiny winding knob parts, so be careful when you open the watch. My watch still works, but I can't adjust the time or date. If you try to adjust the time by moving the hands, be careful not to scratch the paint on the numerals - the white paint will come off easily.

Also, the Indiglo light is decent, but a bit hard to read in the dark because the hour and minute hands are slim.

The leather strap is attractive, comfortable and easy to replace. They tend to last about a year for me - your mileage may vary. Generic replacements are about $10-20 at most watch or department stores.

"I spontaneously ordered this watch after spending several months researching different brands. I was looking for a classic style, somewhere between $100 - $300, and had checked out all the usual suspects: Bertucci, Hamilton, Tag, Skagen, Swiss Army, etc. I wanted something affordable, reliable, and durable; something versatile, that I could get a lot of wear out of. After a lot of time spent comparing and evaluating, I bought this on impulse, without a second thought. In terms of customer satisfaction and value, this is literally the best purchase I've ever made. It's a tenth of the price of its competitors, and after owning it for a week I'm convinced it's the most handsome watch I've ever seen. The proportions, fit, and finish are impeccable. Its styling cues are modern and sophisticated, with subtle nods to mid-century design here and there (the typeface, the notched rectangular field in the center). Additionally, Timex products are known for their quality/durability. Overall, it's a must-buy.
Minor drawbacks: Doesn't have the light-up feature of other Timex models in the same price range, and the band probably isn't the best quality in the world (though the walnut calfskin color is perfect).
Bottom line: It's thirty dollars. Buy two, save one for later, and it's still a great deal.",Buy this watch.,B0000TIIQE

Two small caveats; the stitching on the band began to unravel on the second day and the date can be hard to read when the minute hand sweeps past.

I needed to remove about 4 links (2 from each side of watch band).  My tools on hand were not small enough and I had to order a  watch band link removal kit from Amazon. The kit was about $5-$8.  It included a watch holder, hammer and 3 different size tools to knock out the pins.  Reassembly is easy. I would have liked a recommendation to get the kit or have the tools included when I bought the watch.  Thats the reason for 4 stars.",Nice watch.  Link removal kit sold separately.,B0000TIIPK

"Just wanted to write a quick review to tell everyone how beautiful and practical this delicate watch is.
I have owned this exact watch for about two years now, without battery replacement (and yes I've accidently worn it in the shower a few times, though I wouldn't recommend it)  It is lovely, and awesome.  A great every day watch for a feminine, somewhat old fashioned look.  I love it.  I own antique 14k gold watches, but this is my everyday watch.

I ordered a new one, because I abused my watch a little bit and lost a crystal.  So now I'll have one for everyday at home, and one for everyday going out.  Silly I know, but the old is still taking a licking and keeps on ticking, in the old words of Cameron Swayze.

I highly recommend this watch.  You will love it, and it won't disappoint you.","I have owned this watch for years, now buying my second",B0000TQKCI
I got this as a Christmas present for my mom. It comes well packaged and looks exactly like the picture. The strap is thinner than a normal Timex watch but my mom says it makes it even more comfortable to wear. The Swarovski crystals are beautiful on the watch and the face is small but still easy to read. Great Buy!,Nice Little Watch,B0000TQKCI
"I really like this watch!  It is very pretty, and comfortable to wear.  This is the second time I have purchased this watch.  (I wish I could purchase a new watchband for this watch, since the first watch itself is still in good working order!)
The watch is pretty enough to use as a dress watch, but is reasonably priced, so I use it as my ""go to work"" watch.","beautiful watch, reasonably priced!",B0000TQKCI
"I have had many Timex watches and I love expansion band watches particularly those that look feminine and not industrial.  I wear my watch all day, everywhere but in the shower and I appreciate how easy the expansion band allows me to remove and replace my watch.  The face has a pretty pearlized look and the crystals above and below the face make it look dressy.  My only complaint is that the pearlized surface on the face  creates lines from the center outward.  Too frequently, it is difficult to distinguish the line caused by the face from the hand of the watch.  I have to pick up the face and  move it about in the light to read it which is rather a pain.  In fact I gave up on it as my regular every day watch for that reason and only wear it when I need a fancy look.",Beautiful but Difficult to See the Hands,B0000TQKCI
I logged on to Amazon trying to find a gift for my mom! Mother's day is on May 11! I wanted to buy her a watch because she lost hers!!!

I looked into different brands within the same price range: Tissot, Raimond Wail and Citizen, and I have to admit that this watch fascinated me with its simple, up-to-date and sturdy design.

I have thin wrists, so I had to take it to a watch repair kiosk at the mall to remove four links ($10).

I should have just bought this one first!  I didn't find a better price anywhere for this same model, and believe me, I searched.  It's beautiful, with the perfect dial size for me - not too big to seem like a man's watch, not too small to seem delicate. It's elegantly simple, making it suitable for every day use, while also working well for more dressy use. I am ""big-boned"", most women's watch bands are too snug, but this one fits perfectly. I was a little concerned that the description doesn't mention luminous dial markers and hands, but it does have them! I was also a bit worried about the dual clasp (having bought another watch that was really tricky getting off) but this one has buttons for quick release. And its sapphire crystal dial cover is the best you can get.

"Okay, heres the deal... I am from California... not very cold where I was living and also I would dance back and forth from Hawaii often, not to much snow there either. I got this jacket literally scared of winter cold. In Montreal here. So, it gets cold here and I have to say. This is the strangest experience for me. I wear the jacket and my face is cold. It is cold outside and yet it feels like there is an electric heater inside this thing. The rain beeds off easy and it is just warm. Cold outside but I am in my little cacoon as I walk around. I bought the hood for this thing too. You MUST get the hood with this... so another twenty bucks for that. Now for the quality. Whenever I search for clothes for me... it is hard to find my size. Carhartt has my size! So, no freak feelings here with that. Quality... mannnn, really, the zippers are heavy duty and big. The material is like Rhino skin. What surprises me... well, I am old school. If it is going to be warm it has got to be Thick and Heavy! Otherwise it will not keep you warm. Well, this is light and it is not really thick at all. I would say just like a regular normal weight thick jacket. Nothing that would stand out. The only complaint and it is really not that because I don't care is that the jacket is stiff because of this material it is made of but I am sure in time it will soften up and get more pliable but for now... you are a little bit of a tin man. When it is COLD outside... I will take tin man any day... So, summary. Put the jacket on and I am confident to go outside... this is with a tshirt  on. If I did a long sleeve T and a t shirt over that... and then God forbid a sweater over that... I could go see igloos in this thing then. Too hot. Couple T's or T and a sweater and you are good to go -40. Tis all... take it that and run with it... Very nice jacket. I will never buy anything other than Carhartt now.

We ordered this coat and then realized, after it had shipped, that we had ordered the wrong coat. This one had a much thinner lining, and we thought it would never be warm enough for our winter weather here. We were wrong! This coat is much lighter weight, yet the thinner insulation works as well as the bulkier coats I've had in the past. It's easier to work in because of its lighter construction.

"I work in varying manufacturing environments.  Always on concrete and typically 10-12 hours a day - up to 7 days a week.  Weeks at a time.  Like others I have had the tired and sore feet, achy knees, etc, from this type of work.

I have probably bought nearly every boot out there from numerous companies over the years in search of relief.  Did the inserts.  One day I walked into the boot store in Sheldon Missouri coming back from a morning hunting trip to nose around.  Was just looking around and mentioned I was in search of the perfect boot for concrete.  He came right out with the rockies.  Salesman stated it was the most popular shoe at the local 3M plant in Nevada MO.  Tried on a pair in the store and was instantly sold.  This was in 2005.

The boots are a bit unique.  The soles are a bit spongy and this is where I think the comfort/relief comes from.  You can actually squeeze the sole and notice this.  The insoles are quality as well.  The leather is soft.  For me there is no feeling of breaking the boots in like with my Red Wings.

In my opinion these boots are made for putting miles on them - hence the postal approved status.  I do not wear these doing outdoor work as the leather is a bit too soft for that.  I wear my Red Wings for the rough stuff.  Danner Pronghorns and Mucks for hunting.  They used to be available in brown but now it is only black.  I have both the safety toe and non-safety toe.  The composite toe is the only safety boot I have worn that did not kill my toes.

To make a long story longer - this is the only boot I will wear on concrete.  You will notice the comfort the first time you wear them to work.  I keep them polished and typically replace the insole with a new factory one every six months due to the long hours I put in.

It does a good job of pulling the waist in to give an hourglass shape, but it doesn't do anything to help control the ""pouch"" I've gotten since giving birth.

"I am giving it four stars because Rago continues to be excellent quality (I own a number of other Rago pieces) and because this did do exactly as promised. This piece runs smoothly from the bra band to the bum, so no bulges between bra and waist cincher which is excellent. It has removable garter straps, A+ in my book. And it has reinforced horizontal stitching to really nip in your waist without making things like breathing, eating or sitting down totally impossible. Unfortunately I return it because it just didn't work quite right for my shape. I am rather short waisted and I have a natural hourglass already, so my waist/hips have about 14"" difference between them. The combination meant that the back of the cincher didn't quite cover my bum the way their longer girdles do, nor could it be hitched up enough to rise above it the way their garter belts do, so it left me with a bit of a bisected bum.  I do think this is an awesome product, and had it been a little shorter in back it would have been a keeper for me.","Great for Nipping In Your Waist, Didn't Quite Work For My Body",B000147652

"I was reluctant to buy these because of the ""one size"" fit and because of how much they cost, but I'm happy to say they really do fit  wonderfully and they are worth every penny! They are amazingly comfortable and surprisingly durable...lace panties never last when you wash and dry them with the rest of your laundry, and lets be real, who has time to was all of their underwear separately?

"I picked this over the low-rise because many people were saying that the low-rise is much, much too low.

Unfortunately, as a younger person, the rise on this is much, much too high -- if pulled up so the fabric lies flat, it sits about 1.5"" under my belly button (I am 5'7"").

Go with the low rise, if you were born after 1985.","May be an age thing, but these are far too high for me",B000144RAO

"Finally, a watch that tells more than time!  If you gotta thick wrist (...), you gotta love this.  It gives you uptodate news, stock quotes, weather updates (way cool, man!), and even your worthless daily schedules.  Of course assuming you are still sane from information overload!  This is better than your cell, man, cuz you can use it on that transUSA flight.  I love this new gizmo!  It runs MS software, but who cares.  It's a Fossil watch!","Nirvana, baby!",B0001540G4
"Wow, that guy from Boise sure has a lot of watch rage!  Most of what he/she says doesn't make sense and is not even accurate.  Anyway, I've had this watch for a little over a week now, and let me give you a quick review.
The upshot is, at first I found a lot to complain about, but after a week, it started to grow on me, and right now, I like it a lot, and everyone I show it to is impressed, although most don't think it's worth the price + subscription fee.  Anyway, I don't regret this purchase like I did with the T-Mobile Sidekick.
Pros:
- Lots of geek appeal with real-time information updates
- Changeable watch faces
- Can receive updates from Outlook Calendar
- Atomic clock auto-syncing
- ESPN channel coming at end of January
- 10-second white backlight at the touch of a button
- Alarm clock, chronograph (stop watch), timer, time zones
- FM radio frequency, so low power and potentially low chances of us getting tumors from wearing this
Cons:
- Kinda large, not for slim wrists
- Not particularly attractive physically
- No color
- Battery life can be an issue; I've recharged only once but it's only because I use the animations sparingly and turn off the radio at night
- The wrist band is hard to use and adjust (this is one thing the rage man from Boise got right)
- Update can be slow at times
- You need to set up a travel schedule to receive personalized information (i.e., Outlook appointments) when you travel, which is totally stupid, especially as the set-up page on the Web is a perfect example of stupid programming (but not unlike the typical Microsoft goofs) -- too complicated to explain here, let's just say it doesn't work the way it should.
- Coverage is not consistent, and only works in the U.S. and Canada
My initial impression was this deserved no more than 2 stars, as the watch was kinda ugly and all the information you get (weather, news headlines, up to 15 stock quotes, Outlook calendar, etc.) is nice to have but totally not necessary, especially for people like myself who sit in front of the Internet all day and half night.  Plus, set up was more confusing than warranted, and the battery life issue was a big turn off.
But there is just so much gadget-freak factor in this watch.  It's actually more useful than my Casio camera watch or some prototypes of communicator watches I've seen in Asia, because, at least for a guy, the size is acceptable, and there's something about getting real-time weather and stock quotes that just fascinate me.  The weather channel is especially impressive, especially on cold wintry days like these in New York.  Pressing the channel button to cycle through the various channels -- BTW there's also a special channel that automatically cycles through the channels for you -- has a certain magical power of its own, and I just love showing this off to friends and coworkers, and get lots of pleasure when people come into my office to ask ""oh what is like outside?"" or ""hey show me your watch again.""
Should you buy this?  It's very hard to say.  Luckily MSN Direct offers a free month if you sign up with the monthly plan.  Then if you like it, you can switch to the annual plan and save 50%.  If you don't, at least Amazon offers a nice 30-day MBG policy.","Lots of gadget geek appeal, but not ready for prime time",B0001540G4
"I had the watch for less than 24 hours and it stopped working.  The screen went blank, and no matter how long I charged it, it never turned back on.  I am going to try and get my money back, else I have to wait several weeks to get the old one fixed!
what a rip!  As with any Microsoft Technology, wait until Generation 2!",Mine broke within 24 hours,B0001540G4
"I heard about Microsoft's Smart Personal Object Technology (SPOT) devices a while back, and it intrigued me. Although as a certified gadget geek I have a number of wireless devices that can receive news, weather, and sports, I had always thought that the perfect device would replace my existing watch. While this first generation device isn't perfect, it's not bad.
Opening the box containing the Abacus Wrist Net Smart Watch for MSN Direct (there's a mouthful!), you'll find two small manuals, the watch, and a two-piece charger. The charger consists of a plug (thoughtfully made to fold flat) and a rather clunky charger with an ""arm"" that rotates into place to hold the watch. You just lay the watch onto the arm and it starts charging through induction - no charging port or contacts to get dirty!
You need to activate the watch through MSN Direct to get your news, and it's best to take the $59 one-year subscription rather than go with the $9.95 monthly plan. You will need a credit card to subscribe. Once you've entered your unique watch ID and personal information, you get to pick the type of content you want sent to your watch. At this time (1/7/04) the sports channel powered by ESPN isn't available, but it's supposed to be ready soon.
It takes about 10 minutes to get a confirmation message on the watch telling you everything's OK, and then it can take up to 12 hours for all of your info to show up.
There are five buttons on the device that are used to turn on the white backlight (rather uneven, I thought), change channels, and navigate (enter, next, and previous). The buttons seem a little spongy, but not too bad. The Abacus AU4000 isn't waterproof but will survive splashes. If you're used to very expensive thin watches you'll hate this, but anyone who likes clunky multifunction watches will love this. From a design standpoint, the $299 Suunto N3 sure looks a lot nicer, but functionally it doesn't do anything different than this watch.
A charge is supposed to last 2 - 3 days, and I think I may just put my watch on the charging arm every night when I go to bed. Heavy use of animated screens will drain the battery faster; like any first-generation electronic device, battery life is an issue.
So far I'm fairly impressed, and find the display to be clear and easy to read. Just showing the Weather Channel info to friends has been good for a lot of positive comments, and folks have been sending me MSN Messenger ""pages"" just for fun. If you're an early adopter, you'll probably want to get one of these new watches; if not, wait for the second generation devices.",Watch + Data = Smart Watch for MSN Direct,B0001540G4
"I purchased this watch after a 3 year lack of a wrist watch.  My Phone was too clumsy to look at time, and I wanted a tech saavy watch.  This is my first delve into MS Watches, but so far I am impressed.  Set up was a breeze, Once it had charged (overnight) the morning, it was ready with all my calander and news and stocks right there.  I did purchase the extended warranty, why not its an expensive little new gadget...I want to be covered incase something happens...
One drawback...not water proof per say...it can get splashed...but you have to take it off to shower or swim...  I have a big wrist so the watch is the right size, though it will be big on some people.
I love this thing so far...and no issues yet.",Impressed so far...,B0001540G4

"Had the Fossil watch for over a week now and it has performed flawlesly. Short of a wrist PDA, this is the next best thing. The screen is extremely readable and the backlight is very bright. Yes, the watch needs to be charged, but unless you insist on wearing it 24/7 this shouldn't be a challenge. The charging stand is well-designed - no wires to attach to the watch - just sit the watch on the ergonomic stand and you're set. The MSN site is well-designed and there is a good selection of data sources. One nice feature is that the MSN service provides a local news channel. I've had lots of static zaps over the past week with no problems to the watch. The band takes a little getting used to, but is comfortable. Basically, it's just a fun watch, and if you like the geek factor - it's there - but not THAT geekie that you'll be mistaken for a Borg.

I used the sizing guide to purchase these and it seemed accurate & useful. I normally wear a Misses 6-7/Medium and the recommended size small in On Gossamer Women's Mesh Low-Rise Bikini (plain mesh) fit perfectly as they stretch to accommodate. I wash in machine on cold/delicate and air dry. These would be a good choice for travel as they air dry within 1-2 hours.

- Not too good for a small hand. Though it is possible to adjust the bracelet to different sizes, on a small hand there will be a long part of the band left (under the ""top layer""). It is difficult to make this part invisible, as it tends to come from one of the sides.

- The clasp is tight. Hope it will be easier to open and close after some usage.

- The combination of the brushed metal dial and the golden hands makes it difficult to read, especially in dim light.

- The golden ""piece"" is actually just a thin film layer on the inner side of the glass.",Good  watch for the price paid,B0001HIT1Y

"This watch really deserves 5 stars, but for what it is supposed to do it doesnt, that is keep time, i have bought for myself and my family in total five skagen watches, mainly for the looks, but is dissapointed at the functionality, i wanted a beautiful everyday watch, plus, don't bother about the date function, you may be able to see the date in the picture, but really its close to impossible to read in real life. too small.

my watch kept stopping, thought it was the batterey, changed it but still no change, i will be sending it back, will let you know what service i get, if negative or possitive will let you know, as for the rest of my skagen watches, i have not really tested them as this one as i wear them for a day or so and put it away.

"I have a long history of dissatisfaction with exercise bras. In my experience every single exercise bra BUT this one does nothing more than smash you.  I have a very full cup and it is not comfortable to be smashed into the bra when you're trying to exercise.

This bra has all the features of a ""regular bra"", adjustable shoulder and back straps and  a full underwire but it is reinforced in key areas to provide maximum support.  The material is very sturdy and absorbent without being stiff or confining.

Some of my workout partners wear two bras to get the support they need, in my experience, this bra gives enough support on it's own.  Also, it lasts a long time.  I currently own three of these bras because I workout 3-4 days a week and this way I can always have a clean one.

Upon rewashing (minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket) the yellow dye came out. Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy. In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected, especially, with a product such as this. As a precaution, wash by hand separately and let it hang dry, you still have to be careful with the ""drip dry"" in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip. Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.

"I have been a fan of FiveTen and Stealth rubber for well over a decade. I recently purchased the ""Guide"" and I can honestly say that these are the best hiking shoes that I have ever owned. Comfort, performance, and durability rolled into one shoe. I am an avid hiker. I live just outside of Rocky Mountain National Park, in the Colorado Rockies. The predominant surface on the majority of trails is rock. The ""Stealth C4 Rubber"" is amazing, and greatly decreases the chance of slips or falls. If you are serious about your hiking and are on rocky terrain, I would highly recommend this, or a similar FiveTen shoe!","Comfort, Perfomance, and Durability in One Shoe...",B0001PFQ6W
"just got them today and had to try em right out of the box on a 3 mile desert hike with easy to moderate uphills and downhills comprised of stretches of loose dirt, gravel, scree loose rock packed dirt and i don't know how they grip so well on the loose stuff.  i got them for summer use as my favorite merrell sawtooths are a little warm.  i was concerned about ankle support but no problems and i hauled my usual 40 lbs 3 day pack.
wore them to my kids high school baseball game and got compliments from parents and kids and asked what brand they were and how to get them.  the younger teens recognized them from parcour/freerunners who use them a lot.
i will buy a second pair maybe in canvas this time
ps i wear a size 9.5 i got the size 10 and they have enough room for superfeet insoles and thick socks
and they are a light olive drab but turned to desert tan after the first hike (he he)
best price ive found is 84.95 with free shipping

"I'm definitely not a hiker. What I am is a city-dweller who is on his feet a lot. I'm also becoming a frickin' old man, so my feet get cranky and comfortable footwear has become increasingly important. I bought these shoes because even the less than stellar reviews indicated that they are very comfortable, and because I like the overall looks a lot. I am not disappointed. These shoes feel true to size (11D), and are ridiculously comfortable. Definitely something I can wear all day. They also look great, in my humble opinion. Regarding the color, however, it should be mentioned that these shoes are very, very green -- not at all the lighter khaki shade in the product images (I believe the color I purchased is even called ""Khaki""). They're green, dude. But they're still attractive shoes. I have no clue how they'd hold up to serious hiking, because I don't do that stuff. For walking around, though? Time will tell. They look/feel very well constructed and sturdy. If they hold up, I'll eventually buy another pair.","Amazingly Comfortable, Though Quite Green",B0001PFQ6W
"I like this shoe a lot. I spent five weeks backpacking through European cities wearing only this shoe. But there is one major issue you should know about. It is a stiff approach shoe. This means that if you're not on soft woodland trails it wears on you like stone. There is almost no padding in the footbed. It held up great and continues to be in terrific shape. Best looking shoe of its kind. and I easily waterproofed it. I added a ""sports"" insole and that did the trick. Great shoe. Could really use much better built in padding. I would def buy it again.",Nice shoe. Some particulars,B0001PFQ6W
"The new cut of the Garmont XCRs no longer fits me (too small) after wearing Garmonts for 20+ years. Had to return those to Amazon. Still miss the Sticky Walkers, though. After much browsing found these instead and ordered a pair.

Zappos recommended ordering 1/2 size larger than normal, so I chose the 13.5 size. Fit is perfect and shoe is really comfortable, PLUS much lighter than the Garmonts. Even though these shoes are not officially waterproof, my socks remained dry after several walks in wet weather/terrain in Sonoma County.

Traction is great in all conditions: wet rocks, concrete, mud, sand, even metal grates.

So far, I've used them for lots of urban strolling and moderate country walks. Going to mtns of central PA next week where they will get a much more thorough workout at World's End, Loyalsock Trail and Rickett's Glen.

I must report that it fulfilled all my demands through adequate testing. I even took them bouldering to see how they would hold and was impressed by the stickiness and control the rubber provides. Even though I have a pair of more aggressive La Sportiva for that, these ""Spires"" could be used to certain degree as well. The heel is very sturdy and sticky and held very well on all heel hooks I tried.

"I worked at an indoor climbing wall for 3 years and this was the only shoe I needed or wanted. Here's why.
1. The rubber is as a fantastic blend of sticky and durable. Like I said: 3 years. Never re-soled them. Never had traction problems.
2. They are VERY comfortable for a climbing shoe. If you're going to be spending a lot of time in your shoes, go with these. If you're going to slip on shoes for a quick climb then take them right back off, you could go with something more curvy/aggressive/uncomfortable. That being said, these are still adequate for almost any climb.

Some additional advice: be ready to buy new laces. If you use them/abuse them enough, the laces that they come with these are going to wear out (WAY before the shoe itself ever does). Also, see if you can find a local store (they usually mark them up) that sells them. Start sizing them. Try them on without socks and then remember the size that your feet can BARELY fit into. That's the size you want. After wearing them for a while, the leather will stretch and fit to your foot. Happy climbing and be safe!",Worked at a climbing wall for 3 years.

"I climb at the YMCA twice a week and before buying these, used 5.10's with great success.  These looked like a good entry-level shoe.  However, the grip is terrible for indoor holds.  It creates black marks on the wall and slips often.  I almost seriously injured myself several times.  I definitely wouldn't take them outside.  5.10's have much better/ more reliable grip.

"I've tested these extensively on my home bouldering wall for several weeks now. They do indeed leave a few noticeable black streaks on my plywood wall, and darken up the footholds a bit, but I honestly stopped caring after the first week. I've used these on a few outdoor climbs too, and they worked great then two. There are ridges along the heel for better grip with a heel catch. The rest is mostly smooth, which is still plenty grippy. The feature that these shoes lace up all down to the toe is very useful. I can tighten them easily as much as needed. The laces also fairly ""bendable"". If you bend them out of the way, they stay there. Very useful. The laces also come very long, so you may have to cut them shorter and fuse them with a lighter if needed. These shoes are also wider than others, which is great for bigger footed people. Very comfortable to wear without socks. Highly recommended.",Great shoes,B0001VQMDW
"I've been renting Nomads from my gym for 4-5 months, and finally decided to take the plunge and get my own shoes.

First time out, I ordered a 6.5, because I've been renting 8s from my gym, and the Mad Rock website said a women's 8=men's 6.5 (I'm female). VERY snug, very short, and I will probably be wearing something that tight in a couple of years when my climbing has leveled up, but for now, they're just too darn tight. Send them back and ordered a size up.

Second time up, I got a 7, and they were still pretty snug, but wearable. I was figuring I'd keep them, and let the leather stretch, but the leather ripped after only two hours on the wall. So back they went.

This time, I did what I should have the first time, and matched the european sizes of my rentals with the ones I was buying. Eureka! These are snug but not tight, and I can wear them for hours without pain. The soles are stiff and sticky, so I can edge on tinier, slipperier holds than I'd been able to when wearing the Nomads (which are great, but they're pretty well-worn as rental shoes). I'm not sold on the texturizing on the heel, but it doesn't seem to be getting in the way.

My feet are really wide, so I appreciate that these lace all the way to the toe.",sticky rubber!,B0001VQMDW
"They fit snug and true to size without being uncomfortably cramped in the toe. You could probably stand to buy them up to about half a size smaller than you think you need, but I really like the fit as they are, buy them at size since the laces allow you to customize the snugness within a nice range. As far as climbing shoes go, these are very comfortable and function exactly as I hoped they would. I just wish they had a little bit more grip.",Excellent fit and function.,B0001VQMDW

"These things are amazingly warm for their thickness.  I have these and a couple sets of the Cross Country pants, and I'm extremely pleased with both. This are lightweight, can be worn indoors, and have open, not zip, pockets (this might be important to someone buying them as a running pant).  I use them running, hiking, primarily but also when weightlifting in an unheated basement.  For hiking, be aware they are not really for off trail, the fabric would snag too easily.

The sizing comment in the review is dead on, Sporthill's XXL is everyone else's XL.  I talked with the manufacturer about this, they were apparently unaware of it.  The pants are loose, but not enough to make up for undersizing.

I haven't had any problems washing them as the one review describes.  You don't want to put them in the dryer, but they readily air dry. Actually, thinking about it, these may be able to go in the dryer and the other ones can't, but I air dry them regardless as I just don't put my Sporthill stuff in the dryer in general.

I placed my order, and wore these around after work for a few days- they seemed a little on the short side, but what the heck- I tossed the packaging.

"After purchasing a couple of different ""vintage"" models off of Ebay, one of them stopped working. I took the back off to discover it was made in China and not an authentic Hamilton after all. I then became curious about the second one and looked at that one as well and sure enough, made in China. I did some research and the ""Vietnam era"" Hamilton watches are particularly susceptible to forgeries. I stumbled upon this newly manufactured more retro style model that Hamilton still produces and it was only $100 more than I paid for the stupid crappy knock-off. The face is slightly larger than the older models which I like as the vintage models seem almost like children's size in today's market. The quality is superior and it is a genuine Swiss made watch. I love the ""manual"" movement as opposed to a quartz or automatic movement. I changed the band to a black one once I received it but the khaki band is very attractive as well. The photos on here make it appear almost pea green but it is not green at all. If you are in the market for a well made, vintage looking, military style watch, then I promise you will not be disappointed with this one. And it is about $100 less on Amazon than anywhere else I have seen it. I have since written off buying ""vintage"" watches off Ebay. I can usually find the higher end models locally for the same or less money. I can touch and see them up close and I have just been burned too many times by forgeries. Not bagging on Ebay, it is great for a lot of things but of the more than 20 watches I have purchased on there, 6 have been a total screw job and the rest I found locally afterwards for the same or less money. You don't ALWAYS get what you pay for but in the case of this Hamilton for $255, you get more than what you are paying for. ""*****""",Exceptional watch,B0001WO7GK

"I'm a big fan of not only Hamilton Khaki watches but any military style watch.  This is a simple mechanical (user wound) watch.  The dial is black and simple with high quality, highly visible hash marks and numbers.  The second hand has the discernible tell-tale hack of a mechanical movement.  The case is a dull phosphate non-reflective style finish that lends well to the military style and appearance.  The crown is largish which makes winding and setting time and date easy.  The band, my least favorite part of the watch, is functional and well made.

"Although both Hamilton and Amazon say the watch is water resistant up to 50m (165ft) in less than 1 week it filled up with water. I always made sure to dry it well before winding it.

"Covering the following categories....with a scale of 1-5 rating for each.  The rating is not compared to ALL watches out there, but compared to what I feel it should be for this watch style and at this price point.

CASE: (5)This is 38mm, bead blasted.  This finish is quite nice, nicer than the Seiko SNZG15 in my opinion. The Seiko had more of a ""plastic"" low end look to it with the finish. The bead blasting on the Hamilton has a more refined feel to it....and it should.  It's also very thin at just a hair over 8mm.  The 50m H2O resistance is fine for the intended use.  I'm sure it would survive a swim, or a dunk....but with the rating, don't make a habit of it.  Under that solid back cover (which is nicely engraved), you'll find movement hidden under another dust cover...nice. There is a nice o-ring gasket in a grove on which the back cover screws down onto to tightly seal it.  There also appears to be a small o-ring for the crown as well.  It isn't a screw down crown, but not many field watches have this...and in a mechanical, I prefer it this way.

DIAL: (4.5) Very clear, easy to read, not too busy, plain actually and I like it that way for this style. It's function over style. The numerals are easy to read. The printing is done very crisply.  The simple Hamilton logo in their signature font is also pleasing.  This is listed as a black dial.  Please know that it is really a ""light black"" (aka. dark, dark gray).  I only notice it when it's sitting next to another watch with a deep black dial. Indices are very clear as well.

HANDS: (5) Love them!  The hour and minute hands are superb. The minute had touches out to almost the second indices.  The second hand is my favorite.  It's a bright easy to spot white with a nice lollipop counter balance.  It reaches out to the second indices easily and has a very smooth sweep for an ETA 2804-2.

LUME:  (3) Average for the indices.  Above average for the hands.  Note that the second had is fully lumed as well.  Overall, for a non-dive watch I can't complain too much.  This is one area I would like to see improved.  Ex. It would be nice if a small dot on the indices were not lumed; rather, it would be best for the numerals to be lumed as well as the hands.

MOVEMENT: (4.5) ETA 2804-2 mechanical reliability.  It winds easily and smoothly.  There is NO excuse to overwind this watch.  You can easily feel it tighten a bit towards the end of the full spring tension....then it will hit a wall (if you are going slow and easy, you can hit it if you want). When you feel it, stop....remember go slow, as you should with any wind. I've had this watch for about a week and it will continue to break in and get better with accuracy and should with power reserve as well.  Power reserver, I've had 42 hours and 35 hours so far on intentional depletions.  For this price point and movement, this is what I expected.

**UPDATED** Sept 2017: ACCURACY: (2) This watch, like all ETA movements I've had is easily regulated by the owner if you are willing to do so (I haven't done it and don't really want to though). The watch comes adjusted from Hamilton, likely in only 1-2 positions and the regulation is set at neutral. Out of the box, it ran about 10 seconds fast per day.  After a few days, it was down to 7 consistently.  **UPDATE** Over the past month it's now around +/- 17-20 seconds per day.  I consider this ""acceptable"" but not ideal or ""good"".  I'll probably need to regulate this one myself.

OVERALL FIT & FINISH: (5) For a thin field watch, mechanical, it feels great. The domed sapphire crystal is a nice touch (dome). There is nothing on this little gem that feels cheap in anyway.  I had it side by side with the Seiko SNZG15 and there is no comparison in fit and finish, the Hamilton wins for me.

FEEL ON THE WRIST: (5) Superb.  The lug to lug distance helps this 38mm watch feel more like a 40mm. It doesn't feel too small at all.  I thought this would be an alternative to my favorite 40mm dive watch; but it is slowly becoming my daily watch at this point.  It feels that good.

STRAPS/BANDS: (4) The stap is comes with is a nice leather-lined canvas strap that does break in well and is comfortable.  The hardware is also solid and bears the Hamilton logo.  The color, while a personal choice, is one I'm not fond of.  I would have preferred the black face come with the olive strap.  Oh, well.  OEM strap = 3. However, this watch is a ""strap monster"" and looks great with leather and NATO (rating of 5!).

VALUE: (5) For sub-$300 (should find in the $230-260 range) gray market Swiss made watch from a highly respected Swiss holding company (part of the Swatch Group, the same as Omega, Breguet, Blancpain, Longines, Tissot, etc.), you can't really go wrong here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
NEGATIVES:

OVERAL RECOMMENDATION: (43/50 points = 86% = 4 stars, a grade of ""B"") If you are looking for a SWISS MADE, affordable, solid field watch...this is a good choice.  Yours will probably be more accurate...I hope.","Great value for Swiss mechanical, solid choice",B0001WO7GK

My first ""Anorak""-style jacket is white and has had everything from orange juice to backyard BBQ sauce spilled on it, not to mention grass stains from outdoor sports...and it keeps on coming clean wash after wash...no bleach...without showing wear!  The (optional) teams' name printed on the back STILL looks crisp and the embroidery has yet to fray at all.  We got the jacket via UPS less than 48 hours after ordering and I already popped it on to run to the store.  And, by the way, their customer service was top-notch when I emailed questioning sizes. (The jackets DO run big: more than enough room to wear a bulky sweater underneath...plus, they're unisex, so girls will want to order a size smaller than usual.)  They replied the same afternoon with the facts I needed to make an informed decision.  If you enjoy or wear your jacket half as much as I have, you'll get your money's-worth.",You definitely want to buy this jacket!,B0001XLTL0
"I'm 6'4"" and 300lbs, ordered a XXXL and it fits just the way I like it. Sliped over the t-shirt/sweater I was wearing with room to breathe.  Quality of stitching and workmanship overall is quite good.  Has a permanently attached hood that would do well to go over a baseball cap to keep it off your eyes. Stuffs backwards into the zippered front pocket fairly easily.  Not lined, so don't expect it to keep you warm but it will contribute to warmth by acting as a wind barrier via layering effect.  It will be a while before I have the chance to try the rainproofness. Very happy with the purchase.",My new fishing slipover jacket,B0001XLTL0
This is a great lightweight windbreaker/rain jacket.  Very well constructed.  I ordered a small and am a size 4-6 and it fits perfect.  My husband ordered an xxl and it was true to size as well.  They very cleverly fold up into a built in small pouch for packing - great design.  We ordered them for our alaskan cruise this summer.  These jackets more than met our expectations.,anorak,B0001XLTL0
"I bought this anorak for a recent Ireland trip and it was perfect. I needed something to cover my suede jacket and thought Ireland's often gusty winds would render an umbrella useless.

The material is sturdy, yet light enough to pack into it's own 7"" x 8"" kangaroo pouch, a definite packing plus.",Turfer Anorak Jacket,B0001XLTL0
"We bought two Anoraks for a recent vacation because we didn't want jackets that would take up a lot of room.  I was able to fit both jackets in my small backpack purse and still have room for my camera.  The fabric is much better than I expected.  Best of all, you can actually fold them back into the nice compact size they come in originally.  I was able to easily stuff mine back into the pocket of the jacket, which becomes the ""case"" for the jacket.",Great even for the folding challenged,B0001XLTL0
"I purchased this anorak for my wife because I bought one for myself at the same time. It's compact and light, but unless you're just looking for a windbreaker or there's a light drizzle, buy something else. Any heavy rain will soak right through this thing and leave you feeling miserable.",not waterproof,B0001XLTL0

This is a great basic $10 watch...and for someone like me who loses stuff..esp watches all the time...this is just what the Dr ordered!,Good Watch,B0001XVUFA
"I was looking for a reliable yet inexpensive watch. I settled on the 3 Casio watches that look like this and chose this one of the three. There's the white faced, the black faced, and this one is the yellow faced w/24 hour numbering. (some pictures of this are over exposed. The face is what I'd call a yellowish wheat color. Quite nice.)  All three likely have the same internal mechanism.  My watch was unexpectedly light in weight which is a huge bonus in my book.

The band was cheap as hell, but I chose the ""Watch Band Genuine Leather 16mm Black Classical Vegetable oil treated durable double stitched and padded with gold plated buckle"" sold by Watchmaterial here on Amazon. Now I have a nice watch that looks like $1-200 bucks, and I'm out $20.

So, buy one of these el cheapo Casio watches, buy a 16mm (width) watch band to replace the really cheap band Casio sells with these, and you'll look like $1-200 also. Plus, if you damage it or drop it in the toilet, just spend another $10. I'm considering buying the black one next. I might like that better. My educated guess is that I'll get 5 years out of this one and will likely retire it when the cheap crystal gets too scratched.

I give this product Three Thumbs Up!!!

3-14-12 -- Edit to add:

This watch keeps virtually perfect time. Only my cell phone, ipod, and my computer, which are all synched constantly, do a better job. It's within seconds of the computer time when I adjust it twice a year for the time changes. The ""crystal"" is becoming moderately scratched so I thought I'd buy another watch. Quite likely yours will suffer premature battery failure as mine did, but it's pretty inexpensive to buy 2 watch batteries on Amazon for a couple of bucks. When I buy my second watch I'll probably just put that second fresh battery in it and it should be good for 3+ years.

Good deal? You bet.",Good value,B0001XVUFA
"Even though I looked at the reviews, I did not expect the watch to be so small and for ten dollars I think I could have spent the money on another book, but I did fall in love with the watch face though.",Just not what I was expecting,B0001XVUFA
"I love the look of this watch. I needed $6.00 more for a free shipping offer and I picked this watch.
Two things:
This watch is much smaller in diameter than it looks on the Amazon pages.
The entire watch is 35mm in diameter compared to 40-50mm in most watches.
Second, the watch arrived with a dead battery. Was not working. I purchased a battery, installed it and it's working fine.

Just my observations.",Very Sharp Watch!,B0001XVUFA

"These ""24-hour time"" watches never want to quit.  I have two of them (I misplace my watches), one five years old and one three years old.  After about three years I have to replace the battery, a simple project.  On the older watch, the resin strap broke recently and a commonly available replacement works like new.

I bought this bra to replace one that broke. It molds really well and it doesn't sag at all. I wear a 36C and sometimes strapless bra's sag a bit and don't hold my breasts very well. I was really surprised how happy I am with this bra. I haven't tried this brand before since I am a V.S. bra lover.

"I wore this bra for my wedding. It is so hard to find plus size specialty bras that aren't in giant cup sizes. This bra didn't dig in and had lots of support. My only complaint is that the bra bulged a bit in the center front...it didn't sit flush with my body in that one area between my boobs/in my cleavage. It wasn't a huge issue with my dress, but if you're buying this to wear with a low dress or top it might be a problem. Otherwise, great product!",So many sizes and so comfy!,B0001Y43YO

Just be super careful and read everything.

I have only just opened the box, so I don't know how good/bad the quality is yet. The sizing is right, I am a woman's 8, to that is a men's 6.

"It's a nice pair of shoes but I don't get the hype on converses. They're gorgeous but have absolutely no arch support. As someone with an injury, it's a horrible choice. I could usually handle shoes with minimal support but if you're looking for shoes for comfort, these aren't it. They look nice but if you have flat feet, it looks a bit weird in my opinion. When I put my insoles into them, it's a bit more of a tight fit but works so I think in the future I will order a blue or black. I didn't like the beige-ish color I purchased as almost all my clothes are dark colored. If the shoes are gonna be light, they gotta at least offer support for me, haha.

"I got a lot of compliments on how good these shoes looked on me in the first couple weeks. Though after about a month of wearing these shoes only semi-regularly (only in buildings and occasionally outdoors) they looked like they had been worn everyday for years, with dirt and smudges all over, not just visible on the white tips/logo. About three months, in, and the material inside both shoes are peeling and I can feel it with my toes. About a quarter of the logo has rubbed off. Another thing that I ended up disliking about this shoe, despite my desire to love them, is how hard they are to get on and off. I need to untie the laces and loosen them all the way every time I take them off, and of course this means tying them when I put them back on. They're pretty comfortable still, that's a plus, and they still look all right, but JUST all right, not very good anymore. They laces are also EXTREMELY long, but that might just be because my feet are narrow.",Looks great... at first,B0001Y8YBW

"- Great product at a great price. What else do you want? No fancy designer stuff here, jut a no-nonsense pair of pants that are comfortable, well made and last a long time. I have used Dickies for many years and they compare well with any of the major brands, and they look pretty good. I prefer the relaxed fit but it is just a personal preference. One comment regarding sizes, which by the way it is industry wide, not just Dickies. You may be better serve if you ask for a size down in the pants, vs. the actual measurement at your navel. I was 34 inches, but ordered a 32 which fit well with space to spare. I guess that a few years ago a clever marketer found out that calling a 34 pant 32 would sell better. An ego thing, I guess. Would you rather say that you wear 32 than 34? The trick worked for a particular brand until the rest of the industry caught up with it. And now, we are stuck with sizes that do not fit reality. Go figure, just understand it is not Dickies', but everyone. So much so, that with some imported pants, that keep the right sizes, people complain because they fit too tight...

- Check the dickies.com site to review the options on fit and models. It is a lot more than you think.

- My only complain to Dickies is that the offer below 30 waist size is vey limited.  After an intensive period of diet and exercise I'd reached a 31 waist and there are very few option available for me. America is getting BIGGER.",Your Basic  Jean,B0001YRNZK

"My husband is slim and a carpenter.  So many producers of jeans have taken off some of the belt loops.  He needs the extra belt loops, esp. when he has his carpenter belt on.  The extra loops help him not to get a back ache by giving more support with his belt on.  We have looked and looked and have not found any others.  His waist is a 32-33. The jeans are also very good quality and wash up nicely.  They have a nice slim fit to them which he also likes and that is hard to find now days too.  We hope they do not stop making them and that maybe other companies will return to the original loops.  The only thing we could think of is that they are trying to save expense by cutting back on the loops.

They are honestly the most comfortable pair on boxers I have ever worn.  They are very lightweight and yet very supportive at the same time.

One happened when I pulled the boxer off while I was sweaty and it stuck to my skin; another by some abrasion while I was working - in a pair of jeans.  I spent 20 years in the underwear business - and this sort of slippage should not occur in a quality garment.  I don't mind paying 20 bucks for underwear, but not if it only lasts a week.

"I recently got this watch and wanted to respond to the other review that said this watch was the size of a women's watch.  It's not.  Granted it is not as large as some other men's watches out there today, but to me watches have gotten ridiculously large. It's like having a hockey puck attached to your wrist.  This watch is basically the same size as every other ""field"" watch I've ever had, and I've had many, including those from LL Bean, Victorinox and Wenger.
My only complaint about the watch is that the ticking is fairly loud.  Otherwise it's fine, especially for $40.  The gray face is understated and the Indiglo feature still amazes me 15 years after it was introduced.

I can't tell you what in particular I had against Timex, but there you have it, I was a watch snob. Since I was late for everything and driving people crazy asking them the time, I finally had to buy one for daily wear.
This inexpensive, nondescript little watch has turned out to be one of my better buying decisions. It withstands a ton of physical abuse just from things like  bathing the dog, doing laundry and  spilling coffee all over it. It really is an amazingly durable watch for the price.  I swear the face has not a single scratch..and I NEVER take it off.
I especially like the way it lights up when i depress the bezel. Discreet, but bright enough that I can easily see the time. It does say unisex but I personally think it would look a bit small on a mans wrist. The face size is somewhere around the size of a quarter.

"This is my third Data Link watch.  The first one was one of the original metal models that read downloaded data through the CRT.  Overall, I liked that one especially the glass crystal and what was then a new concept.  However, it was much heavier and the metal around the edges of the case eventually wore to a rough finish and buttons broke. The second one was similar to this one except with the resin band.  The second model was purchased at Wal-Mart.  It did not last nearly as long as the first one.  The resin band cracked, a screw fell out of the face and it quit lighting up for dark viewing.  So far, I like this third one.  It was a bit difficult to take links out to adjust the expansion band.  However, after a couple of links were removed, I like it much better than the resin band model and I paid less than what I had paid at Wal-Mart.  While I like the watches features, it does not completely replace a PDA.  It does however hold contact information that I can have with me in circumstances when I would not carry a PDA (swimming, etc.)  I like this watch.",Good watch,B00020J1G2
"I wanted a watch that could be more than a watch. In this case I was attracted by PDA features. As a long time user of Palm and Pocket PC I have expected something similar to them. I didn't get much.

I have no use for ""Iron Man"" features - memory of 200 laps? several count-down counters? Default PGA schedule?

Software came up and saw the watch and even imported contacts and notes from Outlook. It had dicovered certain duplicates in schedule and when I took care of them - didn't load them in at all any more. Unlike Palm or Pocket, the changes you make on your watch won't be written back. The WORST thing - the watch is not workable as Contact or Notes reader. You get only a 2-line display, one gets taken over by note's name, other scrolls very slowly through your note. You can't go back. you can pause but not move the note back or scroll to more important part. If you have 10 contacts with 1 phone number each, I guess it could work for you. If each of your 50 contacts has a fax, cell and ..... getting thought the clutter is hard. I'm thinking about giving ""Fossil Abacus AU5005 Wrist PDA with Palm OS"" a try.",don't use as a PDA,B00020J1G2
"I've had this watch several months now, and like it very much. I used to wear the Data Link model that read data off the computer screen, but they don't work with LCD monitors, and the accessory that allows use with LCDs is no longer available. The buttons on that watch had developed contact bounce so bad that it was nearly impossible to use anyway, so it was time for a change.

My only complaints so far with this watch are that the tiny shaft encoder that's operated by the stem, to scroll through menus and enter data, is rather touchy. It skips frequently, forcing you to rotate the stem back to the choice you wanted. Also, the stem clicks as you turn it, but the detents don't necessarily occur coincident to the selections. In other words, it takes some fiddling to enter data. But it's not that bad, and pretty amazing that they could fit an encoder in there at all. It's fine as long as it doesn't get worse with use, because entering data can take a lot of stem rotation.

And I wish Timex would use a crystal face instead of plastic, because it doesn't take long for it to get scuffed and scratched, no matter how careful you are.

But other than those small complaints, the watch is a joy to use, the software and cable work perfectly, and the features and flexibility are bound to make your life easier.

Edit: After a year or so, the shaft encoder has become somewhat worse, sometimes skipping a dozen or more letters in a single click of the stem. Rather frustrating to use, but eventually I can get to the data I'm after. Also, while simply standing still the other day, I heard a ping as the metal front of the watch simply popped off and landed at my feet, leaving two little grounding springs poking out. I scraped the old glue off with an x-acto knife, carefully applied some epoxy, and glued it back on. Seems to me they could do better in that regard too.",Very useful features,B00020J1G2

Lovely watch my only issue was how tight it was on my wrist and I have a very petite wrist can't say that bout the rest of me (laugh) it left marks after wearing a day. So Id recommend this watch for a little girl the watch clarity is perfect white face numbers easy to read. I think any little learning how to tell time would fall in love with it. I did return because I couldn't wear in comfort. For any little girl or petite teen would make a great present for Valentine's day ect.,Gorgeous sweetheart watch,B00020J03Q
"This, in my opinion, is one of the prettiest watches in any price range. I've had this watch for around 4 years & it still looks like new.  It finally quit today, & I decided it would cost nearly as much as the watch to replace the battery.  It was about $22 at Target when I bought it.  Went looking and found the same watch, & it is just over $22 now.  I couldn't find one not already running so perhaps the battery won't last as long in this one.  I have problems with nickel in metal, & it apparently had none since I had no reactions to it.",One of the Prettiest Watches but Very Practical,B00020J03Q

"It has an easy to see dial, & dainty bracelet band. It does have more silver than gold; very, very little gold accents that are pale in color.  If you have an average wrist size, you should be able to adjust it easily.  Unfortunately, my wrist is much smaller & the watch ""dangles"" & I seem to hit the face on things.  I don't know if it's water resistent or not.  In one advertisement, it showed to be, but on the box & the watch, it never said so.

I am very allergic to nickel but have had no problems at all with this watch. The other day I accidentally left it in my pants pocket and washed it in the washing machine. True to the Timex claim, it took a licking and keeps on ticking. I hope Timex never discontinues this watch. By the way, I only needed to replace the old one because with the second battery change, my jeweler damaged the bezel which allowed moisture to get in when I submerged the watch.

This one looks as classy and understated as the previous one, but is somewhat smaller in wrist size.  I am a thin woman, with a 6.5"" wrist and this watch leaves an indentation in my wrist.

"My first watch I ever bought was a timex digital with flexible band and thin top. It lasted 25 years till a spring wore out on the button that you push to find out the date. So it was time to replace it. Unfortunetly nowadays all the watches are big and bulky and/or non-digital. This is the flattest digital watch that i could find that was a Timex as well. What I don't understand is if technology is making everything smaller, why watches are only getting bigger?! Features haven't changed much from my old watch to this one except the functions are opposite each other and a little more difficult to program. At first I thought it was because I wasn't use to it but after comparison, it is a little harder to program.

Pros: flattest digital Timex available, visible date and time, indiglo makes it easy to see when button pushed, expanding band allows easy on and off and adjusts as arms strengthen or weaken muscle wise, water resistant.

Cons: very small day of week, easy to accidently set chime on the hour by bumping a button, bulkier than older watches, harder to see time due to indiglo coating on face, bulkier face allows scratches faster and a few other minor issues.

all in all: technology seems to have made a worse watch over time but at least it still works like a timex and is the flattest out there now. That is why I gave it five stars.

I highly recommend this seller as they did send an extra battery with the watch. Worth the extra forty five cents. And fast delivery too!",Takes a lickin and keeps on tickin,B00020J1BC
The watch is great and I like the indiglo feature.  The only fault I can find with this item is that the day is printed too small.  Us senior citizens need bigger print.  Also the expansion band is a wee bit tight.  It's livable though.,timex,B00020J1BC

I purchased the jacket for hiking is long the Skyline Drive in Virginia. The outer layer blocks the wind while the sweatshirt long keeps you warm. The Velcro on the cuffs allows for individual adjustment and comfort. Love all the pockets inside and out  to store things while hiking. Note on sizing: these are unisex and run large. I normally take a size  12 and am almost 6 feet tall and a medium was too big. I ordered it in small and it was a perfect fit.,Great all around casual jacket,B00020OCD4
"This jacket is nearly perfect. The fit is good, the features are great. It adds 15 to 20 degrees of warmth to whatever you're wearing. So if you're comfortable with a sweatshirt at 60 degrees, throw this over it and you'll be good to about 40 degrees. It's also pretty water resistant. My wife liked mine so much that I bought one for her.

The damning issue for us is the zipper. It's awful. It never works without a lot of fidgeting. We joke that we have to swear at the stupid thing before it will actually go up. Hate those zippers.

"This is the second time we have purchased this watch since my daughter lost her first one about a year ago and had been  missing it.  She loves the geckos and finds the watch comfortable to wear and easy to take on and off.  She has a friend who  has a watch in the same line (different design on band and face) who has been wearing hers non-stop in the shower, pool, etc. and it is still working fine!

I am happy to learn, now, (wish I knew it before) that Timex has a kids loss protection plan which means the watch can be replaced for half-price for up to one year after purchase.",My 11 year-old daughter loves this watch!,B00021CLMM
"I'm an adult with small wrists, so I usually wear kid sized watches. I got this watch as a cheap, fun watch to wear in situation where I didn't want to risk ruining one of my good watches. I got a kick out of watching the little lizards going round in circles. (I'm pathetically easy to amuse.) The indiglo feature was very useful at night. The water resistancy seemed decent enough; the watch continued working after I wore it in the shower. The watch performed its duties adequately until the battery died. By that time the watch was so beat up I just threw it away instead of replacing the battery.
Things I didn't like about the watch:
-Crystal didn't hold up to being sprayed with bug repellant. It got cloudy.
-Elastic band gave up the ghost about the time the battery died. Perhaps it didn't like sunscreen and bug repellant either.
-Ticking second hand was rather loud. I used to wrap the watch in a shirt or a scarf when I took it off for the night.

All in all, it's an ok watch if you just want something functional and don't expect heirloom quality.",Cute functional cheap watch,B00021CLMM
"I purchased a 28ff. The band is just a tiny bit small, so it leaves red lines on my skin that take hours to go away, but I expect this effect to lessen with wear as the bra stretches.

The gore does go a bit high for my liking, and it has two metal pieces at the top that I did not expect nor do I like the look of.

So I ordered a 28GG in this bra. But this 28 felt like a 24. So tight. Couldn't even button it on the loosest hook. I would also size down a cup if I were you. Up a band and down a cup. I would order a 30 G if I were to do it again. Maybe even a 30FF.

"I bought this watch for its ruggedness, simplicity, reliability and also for the Indiglo illumination feature.  It is excellent on all these accounts.  What is keeping me from giving it 5 stars however is the sweep second hand does not line up with the second markers on the face.  I sent an email to Timex customer service and received an immediate reply informing me that, while it is not possible to adjust the watch, they would replace it if I sent it to their facility in Arkansas, free of charge.  I will put the watch in the mail tomorrow, per their instructions. When (if?) I receive a watch in return I'll update this review.  Review update.  I received the replacement watch about a week ago.  The good news is it works well and is a good watch for everyday use.  The not-so-good news is the sweep hand is about as inaccurate as the original.  So, while I give Timex good marks for having a good, basic product and a very reliable customer service department, I really can't give this watch a full five stars due to the sub par product quality.  Recommendation:  If you want a good, reliable watch that will probably run for a while this is as good as any at this price.  If you want all that and quality craftsmanship you'd be better off spending another twenty-plus dollars for a Pulsar or maybe even a Seiko.",Product quality?,B00022AALA

"Let me start by saying that I've worn a fair amount of western style boots and hold them to a higher standard than most. Realistically, I'd give these a 4.5 star review.

Comfort/fit:
These bad boys are comfortable! I have a pretty wide foot, but i did not feel like these required a lot of break in time. My job requires me to do a lot of walking, up to 10 miles a day, and my feet always felt great. I've even jumped of high retaining walls and the cushion in the Ariat souls are awesome. THEY DO HAVE A TALL HEEL, which is the case with most cowboy boots, so be aware that. I'm 6'1, 190ibs, medium/large width foot and a size 10.5 - these things feel great.

Durability:
I wore these boots nearly everyday for a year and a half. Working 10+ hour days and dancing in them a few times a week (not the best for dancing because the bottom is pretty grippy, but they'll do the job). They held up pretty well. Unfortunately, my job requires me to use chemicals that are very hard on leather, I didn't keep them polished, and the side ended up splitting. KEEP THEM POLISHED and they will last a long time. I bought another pair very similar to these right after they wore out.

Style:
Great style, you will get compliments on them. Especially if you polish them, they get really shiny. Plenty of western style, without being too flashy.

All and all, these are a great boot. Keep them polished and you will be very happy.",4.5 - GOOD BOOTS - KEEP THEM POLISHED,B00024QTFO

"I ordered these boots for my dad, who is impossible to please. He is very fussy about his boots, and they needed to be:

black, not too shiny, not have an advertising logo visible, be unlined (just leather, so he can wear them in summer), have classic styling and stitching, rounded toe, not too grippy on bottom, but not absolutely slick, have no leather ""by-products"", go up high enough on his leg, and fit under his jeans. We actually found something close to custom order - for about $250-300, non-returnable (Did I mention they couldn't be more than $150?). Not only would that seem impossible to find, but he needed them to be available in extra-wide sizes because I guess his feet are a bizarre shape. AND he wanted them by next week, since his ""work sneakers"" were falling apart at the seams. He wanted these to be his work boots.

I received the boots within a few days, and gave them to my dad, who slipped his feet in and lit up. I checked in a few days later and he said they're so perfect he almost doesn't want to wear them to work - they're just too nice. I did see he wore them to church a few days ago. The impossible to satisfy was finally satisfied by these boots - so I HIGHLY recommend these to any man looking for a comfortable, durable, attractive classic leather boot.

"My feet are probably shaped like trapazoids, so I always have a difficult times with shoes, workboots, and athletic shoes. If I found a pair that did fit, they would have wear / pressure points shortly after wearing in.

I would never be able to fit into a standard pointy toe cowboy boot.
I previously had a basic Justin Roper that had worn out.

With these Ariats, a 8D width was to narrow at fitting. I did purchase a 8EE, which seemed a but snug putting on and off for a while, but is perfect now.

After 7 years, I've been very happy and praise the comfort and durability. I would be happy at buying the exact same replacement. But they're in great condition, I'm actually shopping for just a replacement footbed ""insert"" because the heel cushion is wearing through. (still available and only $20)

The leather on the toe has some scrapes and is slightly worn down, but really only needs to have some polish. The sole are excellent, have a wonderfull forefoot pattern, and have an amazing solid arch. The heals are still in excellent condition.

Normally my foot would wear out the interior leather or fabric of a shoe / boot, especially in the forefoot or around the sides of the heal. The only slight interior deterioration these boots have would be the upper interior fabric from flexing against my foot as they bend and I'm crawling on my toes... I bend, squat, kneel, and croutch down alot and I've had these boots since my kids were toddlers.

The roper boots may not have the ""pop"" and flash as other styles, but I have worn these dancing. These may not slide as much on the dancefloor since they have a great forefoot traction, but do well enough... I have occationally worn these motorcycle riding (street)on nice days. You will need to have your foot firmly planted to hold the ballanced weight of a bike. I prefer boots with heavier ankle support, and softer soul with more grip than what these offer... especially stopping on country roads with unlevel surfaces and road debrie.

I also have:

Nike nunning / athletic shoes
Shetcher leather casual shoes
Cat 8"" leather steeltoe construction workboots
Danner 8"" leather goretex hunting boots
Danner 8"" leather workboots - Used everyday for work and motorcycling
Chippewa 10"" leather laceup packer boots

I'm buying this pair as a backup for the first pair that I bought at a boot store last year.

"The description that this watch band fits Casio G-Shock is incorrect. I purchased this item to replace the original 16-mm band of a Casio G-Shock Model DW-5600E (The Classic). The Timex TX16G14 does not properly fit this watch. The 16-mm width is correct but the recesses molded into the band where it inserts into the body of the watch (at the spring bars) are not large enough to properly seat the band. The spring bars can be forced into place but the watch band then rigidly sticks out on both sides of the watch in the same plane as the watch body, and doesn't wrap snugly around the wrist (i.e., there is a large gap between the band and one's wrist on either side of the watch body). Subsequent research on other websites show that the various G-Shock watches have specific fitments for the 16- and 18-mm bands. I recommend identifying the Casio model number for the band that properly fits your watch and order the original factory band (which is more expensive) instead of this generic ill-fitting item. I did so and the new replacement band (with Casio factory replacement band number 71601288) fits perfectly.",Does not fit all Casio G-Shock watches,B00024WAPW

They are water resistant (not waterproof) and have held up well. My only complaint is that I can't lace them tight enough at the ankle because the two sides of eyelets actually touch. I have perfectly normal sized ankles, not skinny at all, and I wear cushioned socks, so I can't comprehend this design flaw. I'm surprised that almost no one else has reported this issue. I have tried many different styles of hiking boots, and these have been the best for my medium-wide feet. They run at least a half size large. I would purchase these again.","Really good, comfortable boots, with one problem...",B00024QR60

"I've purchased these watchband for a number of years. Have hair on my wrists so I don't like metal bands that last longer but pull my hair. Always have one extra in the drawer so when the leather band gets loose (the band does not actually break, the holes wear out, the clasp is not tight and the watch falls off.) They last for over one year on my wrist.

In the past they have not been easy to install. However, I just replaced the band today and noted a new feature. They now have a tiny knob on the spring so that with your fingernail, you just pull back on the knob, it retracts the post, you align the post to the hole and let go. This new feature changed a frustrating 5 to 10 minute install process to less than 30 seconds. Also, it will come in handy when I take it off for future replacement. The install process could not be any easier. Great new addition. Highly recommend.",Great new installation feature; Now 5 stars,B00024WC7S

It has a satin finish, not glossy and that is ok with me.  My wrists are not very big and the regular length fits fine.  I use the 5th hole of 8, so it could still fit a smaller wrist and the unused tail is not excessive.  I only deducted one star because I suspect it may not be super durable, but still a pretty good value.",Good for the price,B00024WC7S

I measured the gap on the watch, it's 16MM, but you actually can't compress the pin enough to fit into the 16mm gap.  Also the elastic band is 20mm wide so to fit this on a watch with a 16MM gap you've REALLY got to force the band.  You've got to work to compress that extra 4mm.  it's tough.

"Had an old watch that I used for camping and the leather band broke. Replaced using this band - and while the band is great, it makes the watch itself look old. Installation was a little tricky, there is an elastic strip about two inches long attached to the band - so you attach the watch pins (2 new ones that it came with the band) by passing the pin under the elastic while the watch is sitting on the elastic. This keeps the watch itself off your skin (the band is the only thing you are in contact with) - which should protect the pins and the watch lugs from body salts and extend the life of the pins and watch lugs.",Nice band,B00024WLD8
The band does fit the Casio DB30 watch.  It's a little bit shorter in length than the original one.  It is a little thinner than the original and has a cheaper feel.

"I'm impressed with this watchband - it seems to be durable (I've used it for a couple of weeks now), it's comfortable and it looks nice. It has no frills which is exactly what I want from a watch band. It was easy to install (make sure you have the right watch band tool if you are going to do it yourself without tears - I haven't used the attached product myself but you want something like it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paylak-Watch-Band-Spring-Bar-Remover/dp/B000A7KB7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paylak Watch Band Spring Bar Remover</a>) and came with all the components (the little spring bars were included which was surprising to me for such an inexpensive product). There are no signs of early wear so it appears that proper dye was used to stain the leather. If you're looking for a basic black watchband with silver colored buckle, this is the one.

Also I noticed that this watch band is slightly smaller (less long) than the one I replaced. This is nice for me since I have a relatively small wrist - I buckle it right on the middle hole. But for a really burly guy this band would be too small probably.","Simple, quality watchband at a very low price",B00024WC8W

I had been looking for a nice looking band and even ran to my local jewelry store, the bands I found were in the $30 range so when I saw this one for less then $5 with good reviews I figured I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! This band is a perfect replacement for my Citizen watch. It's not even close to the original band but it looks good and it fits perfectly. It did come with 2 pins to attach it to your watch, in my case the pins were too long and I fortunately still had the original pins so I was able to recycle those with this new band.

"Though the band is certainly functional, the stitching is not very durable.  After wearing my watch with it for only a day, the stitching on the hanging end of the strap started coming loose.  It doesn't seem to have affected the function of the band, but I don't know how it will hold up in the long term.

As for the pros of this band, it's comfortable and can hold even very large watches - I use it with my Seiko Monster and it seems that the band is big enough to hold a considerably larger watch.","Handy, but not so high quality",B00024WLAQ

This band, on the other hand, causes that band housing to hang out or protude over the band creating an unattractive appearance.

As I installed the bands, the exterior skin cracked with the bending required, showing the white material beneath. Also, the springs that hold the bands to the watch are not high quality. Of the four springs I used, one of them did not re-extend once it was compressed. I will post a pic if Amazon allows this. The non-expanding spring was basically useless, and I had to use the spring that had been on the previous band. For an everyday watch that you don't care too much about its appearance, it's a relatively good value.

The leather band is great looking. I reused my original Lugs (Spring bar), great fit.

"This is a great product,just as discribed. The leather is soft and conforms to my wrist after a few days.

I have had the new strap on for about two weeks and it is adapting to my wrist very well and looks great. Good deal from Amazon.,Watch repair,B00024WBTW
"This watchband has at least a couple of shortcomings for my application.  The first is that it is shorter than the band that was originally on my Timex Expedition.  It was long enough, but just barely.

I agree with an earlier reviewer that the leather is very stiff.  The second is that the quality of the leather is so poor that any kind of abrasion results in the smooth surface being removed.  My watchband looks like a cat chewed on it.

Finally the fixed loop that secures the band broke a couple of days ago.

I will be buying a Timex replacement for this watch.  My recommendation is that you avoid this watchband.","Ordered in January, broken in October.",B00024WBTW
"this is definitely a cheap watchband. I can hardly believe it is leather. It works, keeps my weekend watch on my wrist, but is so stiff it can't conform to my wrist and instead is trying to make my wrist conform to it.",You get what you pay for...,B00024WBTW

I'll give it 4 stars because I can't vouch for durability, but if it lasts beyond 6 months, I'll upstar my rating.",pretty good for price,B00024WBTW

It is a tube sock so I was concerned that it wouldn't look right as compared to a traditional wool dress sock.

"I purchased these boots about 8 years ago and have finally worn them out.  I work in the garden year round almost every day and I have put them through some pretty rough treatment.  They've finally cracked all the way through at the back of the ankles. I've duct taped them over and over but it's time to get another pair.  What I love about them is because of the tight ankle fit they never slip off so I've never felt unsure or wobbly in them.  The foot treads are sturdy so I can wear them for 8 hours continually and my feet won't hurt or feel tired when I take them off. I even wore them on a ship once and I had to jump on deck from the dock platform.  I felt very sure footed and confident.

They don't come in ladies sizes though (bummer!  I have a very narrow foot and wear a 6 1/2 to maybe a size 7 shoe (depending on the maker  If you have a foot size similar to mine, buy the men's size 5 boot.  It will fit you perfectly.  I am looking forward to the next 8 years in my new boots, (or longer if I take better care of them.)

I will say that because of the tight ankle fit, that is probably why they cracked at seam at the back of the ankles. I used to step on the back of each heel to be able to get them off, not recommended.  I would suggest purchasing a boot jack to get them off because after a long day, your feet might get sweaty and they can be a little difficult to get off.  If I could justify spending $400 on a pair of Le Chameau Chasseur boots with the full length zipper, I'd buy those in a heartbeat, but I've got better things to do with my money and anyway, these Le Crosse boots have never let me down.

UPDATE  February 26, 2017.  Okay, I am ready to order another pair.  The previous ones lasted almost exactly two years.  The exterior is fine except for some minor cracks in the rubber.  The cracks haven't gone all the way thru but I notice the lining on the inside of one boot near my ankle has worn away completely so even with socks, I am starting to get a blister. I have put these boots thru so much wear and tear and I am sure they would have lasted longer if I'd taken better care of them.  I still really love these boots.",Boot for a lady,B0002A7GK0

I highly recommend Shadowline for any woman who is having change of life issues. The feel of the material is perfection as far as I'm concerned. It is cool and smooth to the touch and yet satisfying to wear in cool weather when worn in a gown and robe set. I am amazed at how comfortable this robe wears. Best of all it washes well and requires hardly any drying time. I can wear this all day and look presentable if anyone comes to visit.

"I'm usually a 35C. But since bfing 3 babies, my ""girls"" aren't (as perky) what they used to be. So I bought a B for a little extra lift. I knew they wouldn't look like the picture, I was just hoping the push up would help & the bra wouldn't end up at my waist! So I bought 2 bras with great reviews on Amazon to pit against each other.
They fit pretty close to exactly the same
I usually have problems with them staying up but both are surprisingly good about that!
LeMystere has a bit more coverage
LeMystere doesn't have lace at the top
LyMystere comes with nude straps (not clear)
Lily of France was cheaper

I took pics with them (under my dress) & then one with my black VS plunge, it's not strapless but it is my new favorite push up. So I wanted to see the difference.

Both of these models have goretex liners with a heel counter (between the gortex & outside leather) to provide support to the heel (not talking about the ortho insert).  On the right side of the right foot at the front edge of the heel counter the Grouse boots had a pressure point on the bottom / edge of my foot (felt similar to a small rock in my shoe).  Wearing them around the house did not seem to ""break them in"" and I think my foot would end up quite sore after a hike in these boots.

These are an extremely nice looking, well constructed pair of all leather (2.0-2.2 mm thick), gore tex, 600 gram thinsulate boots.  They came with orthotic partial inserts, but for my preference I put full size Super Feet Greens in them instead. These will work extremely well for my intended uses.  I researched extensively other boots: Lowa, Meindl, Schnee's Granite and Kenetrek's which are all extremely well made and firm underfoot with full rands as well.  My requirements were for a boot that would serve me well pheasant, elk, mule deer and antelope hunting in South Dakota and Colorado and general use for winters in Colorado.  I am not a sheep hunter, and did not need the additional technologies in those other extremely high quality boots.

"Danner builds boots. Not jacket's or hats or underwear... Just boots, and they do an exceptional job of it. Certainly Danner's are not for everyone, just like a differnt motorcycle helmet manufacturers different brands fit different people. Danner's are narrow by design, and do tend to run a bit on the flat side in the arch.  But if they do fit your foot shape, you will never go back to anything else.

Acadia's are worn by most of the people who are out there protecting you every day.  Fire, police, and military personnel are the people who these boots, and in that task they meet all the requirements those professions demand. I've worn the Acadia since 1996 on my job as a professional firefighter/EMT and though I've tried a few other kinds of boots over the years; I always come back to the Acadia.  These boots have seen me through 200 degree ground on wildland fires ( NOTE- these do not meet current wildland specs any longer - boots must be full leather)HAZMAT incidents, and more muddy ditches on motor vehicle accident's than I can count.

Are these boots more expensive than a cheap pair of ""tactical"" boots? Yes, but with a pair of Danner boots you get the ability to have them reconditioned, as well as owning a boot that will outlast almost any other on the market, and they are made in the USA in Portland, Oregon. I still wear my original pair I got in '96 for yard work and such. If they fit your foot, you won't be disappointing in spending the extra money to get the best.",Exceptional boot.

You cant go wrong with these boots, as I am a police officer in NW PA, where we see very brutal weather in which I have NEVER had a wet foot, and very seldom do my feet get cold.

There are no local stores that stock these and I couldn't try any on. I went to the Rocky website and asked them what I should order; they said that the 10D should fit. It didn't and I wanted to exchange for the 10W, but the Amazon seller did not have the size. The quality of the leather and stitching was excellent. The boot even has a leather lining! The footbed was fantastic and the looks were more conservative with the contrast in colors being a little less - this was perfect. I will try again later to get the 10W.  I highly recommend this boot AFTER you try it on. If you've tried on other boots, this 10D is wider than Ariat and narrower than Justin in the same size.",Excellent quality and looks -- runs a little narrow.,B0002LDVQW

"Finding a good wire free bra that offers support is a huge challenge as you know.  This is mostly comfortable and supportive, but I do have to be careful so there is no spillage.  The other problem that while there is no under wire there IS wire on either side of the cups under the armpits and it digs into my skin.  If not for these two issues it would be perfect.  It is a little deceiving to call this a wire free bra but have wire on the sides, while it does lend to support it detracts from the comfort.  It is better than other wire free bras I have found as it is not like a sports bra, it has shape like regular bras.",Supportive but not perfect,B0002LILA8

These shoes seem to be either seconds or possibly knock-offs.  The front part of the shoe fits very close and the back it very loose.  The leather finish on the left shoe does not match the right - the left is pebbly and stiff, the right is smooth and soft (I prefer the right).  I need to wear thin socks to prevent the left shoe from pinching my toes, but this makes the backs even looser.","poor quality, not comfortable",B0002LI9BO

bra - obviously we gals who like wire-free want comfort!  Easy to take out with just a snip of the scissors below it

"I ordered these Jockey underpants after talking with a friend, who really likes these undies.  I ride horses and have issues with rubs from the saddle with almost any other underpants I have tried.  This brand fixed my rub problem. I like the covered elastic legs and the high leg cut design. What I did not like is the fact that one color (dark gray) shrank two sizes when I first washed it.  The other colors did not shrink (white and heather gray).

"These are beautiful thigh highs, and ""Little Color"" is perfect for looking a little tan but not too much.  However, they run small.  I'm 5'4"" and 120 lbs (size 4-6 or small in clothing), but ordered the C/D size (which is meant for people heavier than me or taller than me) in order to accommodate wearing these a little higher up than normal thigh highs (to avoid bumps and to be able to wear them with short dresses without the lace showing).  Even though I ordered a size up (size C/D, which is one size bigger than the size chart recommended for me), they were still a little too tight on my thigh and didn't go up as high as I wanted (they just fit at normal mid-thigh height but were a little tight on the thigh band).  Had I ordered size A/B (which is what the size chart recommends for my height and weight), they would have been too small and probably would come only slightly above my knee.  So, I suggest ordering at least a size up from what the size chart recommends if you want to be comfortable and not have them be too short.","Great thigh highs, but they run small",B0002LICNO

"A classic style, with classic lines and curves, and leather to band it all underside enlivens time as if it were the first sun rising. Timex brings in this watch what time once was: a simple and pure marking of moment to moment.

This watch has no internet connection. It has no date feature. Triathlons and moontrips are not recommended while wearing this watch. But this watch, in giving you time, will bring you the world.

Wear this watch with your best suit, with a sharp white shirt and, if the weather is chilly, wear a plain plaid wool scarf. With a silver-hued frame and rich black leather strap, you will notice heads turning, wishing they wore this fundamental accessory. Traditional ensembles are timeless, and will lift you above the less dapper, less dashing dancers at the dinner ball.

When she sees you, that love of your life yet unmet, know what time it is. She'll want to know, and you will be prepared. As you provide the time, she'll provide her name. Always know the time, and you'll always know her name. Forget the time, and she may leave without notice.

Take her hand with your right hand. Your watch is worn on the left. The Easy Reader model has large digits, and only takes a glance to know how long you have for the ferry, for the sunset, and for the moon to rise. Your love will grow without hurry.

If things get late, have no worry. Indiglo lighting will illuminate the face with a swift press of the button.

If, by owning and wearing an Easy Reader Timex watch, you are able to share with her your time, know that when tomorrow comes, she'll give you the time of day.

"Is this a shoe? I went to a local store to find a new running shoe and tried on four pairs including the Omni 13. Every other pair felt like I was wearing shoes. I thought something was wrong with the Omni 13 at first because it did not feel like I was wearing shoes, but then I realized that this is what it's supposed to be like wearing shoes.

They're very comfortable for walking around in, but I doubt many of you are reading this for a review of these shoes for walking. I did go for a run today, the first with these shoes. I didn't feel like there was any break-in required other than wearing them about for two days beforehand (and I'm sure I could have run out of the store with them and be comfortable until the police caught me for stealing shoes). I didn't have any blistering or hotspots, and there aren't any sore spots on the bottom of my feet after.

There was one issue I found with these shoes. When running today with the Omni 13s the air temperature was 85 F, while last week when running with my worn out Puma Vectanas the air temperature was in the 60s. So, I have to give only 4.5 stars to these shoes. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't support half stars, so it rounds up to five stars.

Update: I'm removing another half star (now a solid 4). I've found that when wearing these shoes NOT running, that there are some surfaces they seem to be incapable of squeaking on. They've had miles of break-in, yet they still squeak on the floor at work. It does not get any better. On the upside, it's only this floor that I've had it squeak on. Other floors of similar materials are quiet.

While I'm updating, in continued runs in the shoes, they have done wonderfully. I can't say the same for my socks.",Is this a shoe?,B0002M14II

"Background - I switched to Saucony after having the same issue with Merrel trail runners (which i went to after Adidas), so the issue here may be my setup. I have very high arches, so i have to swap the stock insoles with Superfeet Green or Orange replacements. My usage is for hiking with a medium weight pack, not trail running.

Now on the the review. These shoes are amazingly comfortable right out of the box, and require little to no break-in. My challenge is that they are basically disposable items for me. After approximately 90 days, i consistently wear holes into the heels which cause them to chew up my feet (heel) as soon as the holes form. This behavior is consistent with their last generation 4.0 shoe as well as this one. My last pair (my 3rd set) was purchased in November, and i will be replacing them in February. I have tried multiple different sock combinations, liner & sock combinations, and blister pads to combat this and not found a successful combination to stop this.

So in summary - I give the shoe 4ish+ stars for comfort and support, but 2ish stars for durability. I'm guessing that other reviewers that stick with the Saucony insole do not have this same issue based on their feedback. Based on the fact they are cheap, i will stick with them but sure wish there was a brand i could use that didn't have this problem.",Great shoes - for 90 days,B0002M14TM
"This shoe has everything I was looking for
1) Stiff sole. Easily twice as stiff as the average running shoe.  Can withstand pretty rough terrain, on par with a hiking shoe. Great support.
2) Cushy insoles.  Provide soft feel without mushiness.
3) Versatile.  The styling of the grey color is muted enough to wear the shoe for pretty much anything, anywhere.  The trend today seems to be garish colors and eye catching style.  These have are understated and utilitarian while still looking good. The yellow on the outsole is not actually as bright as pictured.
4) Air flow - The material lets your foot breath freely. I like the fact that there is no waterproof layer in this model. Personally I despise Gore-Tex as it seems to trap moisture to the point your feet are soaked anyway.
5) Roomy toe box and nice width. I usually seek out W, E or EE, so buying D width usually doesn't work out.  My somewhat wide feet had no problems fitting into the Xodus 5.0.

Cons? If you have narrow feet, like a more minimalist and/or a very light shoe, or more eye-catching styles, this may not be for you.","Understated, super versatility",B0002M14TM

"These slippers have springy foam soles and an adorable faux fur construction avec pom-poms.
No issues except the poms tend to come untied, so double tie them. I don't recommend
wearing these outside as the bottom covering is just fabric. But hey, they're slippers.
And they're darn cute. I image over time they will get even more roomy, so buy a pair
of cute thick socks if that happens. I kept them on when entertaining and instead of
looking at my chest everyone was looking at my slippers. I think it was a look of envy.",Cute Overload,B0002M1OOM

"I love this style of shoe. It did fit too big. I normally wear a 7.5 and have traded it back for a 7. Barefoot it might work for you, but with hoses definitely too big. Looking forward to getting the 7. Such a comfy shoe with a good padded sole.

Update: I received the size 7 and I love them. It is the tiniest bit tight across, but I do have a bunion there that is the cause of the tightness since the other shoe fits perfect. Would definitely recommend and am going to purchase in another color as well as try a similar style of LifeStride pump.",My new fav!,B0002M2X0Q

"I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid. I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago, so haven't had to look for new till now. Well, almost the same sneaker... These don't seem to be made to the same last as the old models; they aren't quite as good a fit, but are still pretty comfortable, and the sole is still flexible and light weight. The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone. I'm sorry about that, as it gave them a more streamlined appearance.

Not falling off my foot big, but I have extra room. If they stretch over time I may be in trouble!  When you first put them on they feel snug because of the fur lining, but after you wear them your foot sinks into it. I'm not sure if the 7-8 would have been too small.. but.. If I get another pair of these I will probably get the 7-8.

"These shoes felt broken in from the get-go. They run large; even with a pair of insoles, I wear them with medium-weight socks, as anything thinner would mean my feet have too much freedom inside the shoes. The interior is synthetic, but it does a fine job at wicking away moisture.

The rubber soles wear well, though I've been using taps to extend their life. Initially the leather uppers looked good, but with time they have become less attractive (I've had the shoes for a year). High-quality leather uppers improve with age and generally develop fine, delicate creases with use. These leather uppers, on the other hand, have developed coarse, unsightly creases; they look like crinkled vinyl. For the record, I use shoe trees in these shoes. On the plus side, the shoes are adept at repelling water. When wet, the leather appears rough, but once dry it turns back to normal.

In short, these are fine for occasional use or for a brisk walk in the rain. They'll serve you well for a while, but don't expect too much.",OK FOR THE PRICE,B0002M6MIU
"Ordered these shoes after I couldn't find a pair in my size in local stores.  They are quite comfortable.  However, they are also quite fragile.

They are comfortable and move well with my feet as I am typically going from kneeling on the floor to check things on computers in the office and walking down seemingly endless hallways and up and down stairs all day.  The soles perform as billed, if I pass through a wet hallway or an oily shop floor they really do not slip.  I probably would not wear them with a suit, but for daily wear they are just great!

"I have a pair of the shoes that I received as a gift a few years ago. The typical life for a pair of shoes is normally very short for me. Either the heel comes off (because I tend to pry them off without first untying them) or the sole splits just under the ball of the foot. But these Dockers are the toughest shoes I have ever worn. All the stitching has held and they show no signs of coming apart as I have become accustomed to with my shoes. And since they do hold up so well, the leather just looks and feels better and better as time passes.

I got a second pair intending to replace the old ones, but ended up sticking them in the closet for now. The old pair still feels and looks great so I will continue wearing them until they wear out. If they can wear out. These shoes are tough.",Indestructable!,B0002M6MIU

"This is an attractive sandal, but they must run very narrow because the wide size is not wide.  I own two pairs in two different colors and it is the same for both.

"Well, first, the pants run small, I always wear the same size pants, and these were a bit tight. The biggest problem, though, was that the pants wore through on the seat after only wearing them about 8 times. I work in an office, and sit at a chair all day, and the pants wore through right on the right seat pocket! I'd imagine it's from sitting down all day, but still, I've never had a pair of pants do that before, or since. I'm pretty easy on clothes, I've got jeans and other khakis that I originally bought in college. I won't be buying any more IZOD products.","Buy a size larger, and don't plan on wearing them long.",B0002MAYV6
"These slacks were tight at the waist and normally a 36""x32"" fits me fine. Considering they are all cotton and will shrink some with drycleaning or washing I don't intend to keep them. If they fit you properly I am sure they will wear well and they are a good looking slack.",IZOD Chino,B0002MAYV6
"The biggest benefit and selling point of these pants is the ""Metrix Fit"". What IZOD has done is make the rise of the pant (distance between the waist and crotch) in proportion to the inseam length. Short inseam = short rise, long inseam = long rise.

These are perfect for guys with shorter inseams who normally have the problem when they buy other pants that the rise is too long, the pants are baggy and the back/bottom of the leg hits the ground and wears out. You may be tempted to go with a shorter inseam so they don't hit the ground, but you will probably still have baggy pants. I have a 31"" inseam (that is rarely available) and 32"" Dockers used to have the best fit since their inseam is slightly shorter than others, but the back of the leg sometimes still hits the ground. IZOD's Metrix Fit with a 30"" inseam fit great. The legs are just at the right length (barely - I wish they made 31"" inseams), don't hit the ground, and most importantly - they are not baggy at the crotch.

"These Chillax are not the padded shoes of the former Ortholite shoes Keds once made.  These shoes are meant for low-level activity, such as an office worker, or a teacher who stays behind his desk. who doesn't walk much while at work.  They slip on and off easily and can easily be tossed into a beach bag or weekend bag for a quick get away.

My experience with Keds is the uneven quality control.  Some shoes are well-made with tough seams.  Other shoes look like factory rejects sold at clearance price to rid the factory of its stock.

You can wear these shoes all day and your feet will be comfortable all day and night, they are fully padded inside and the vamps are higher also which gives you a lift especially if you are short like I am. They feature a good quality canvas upper and quality stitching all around. I am currently wearing them just around my home as house shoes, sometimes I even forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable that I accidently wear them outside, that's how comfortable Grasshoppers are. In my opinion these shoes should be renouned for comfort. Believe I will continue to purchase these shoes as long as they make them. I recommend these shoes to everyone who is seeking a quality made most comfortable shoe. And a big plus they even supply you with a shipping label with your order, that's the sign of a confident manufacturer. Added to my review this is a update to my last review, these Grasshopper Jensens slip on shoes is that they did not last as long as I thought or expected to last it is now a year later and their are signs of wear these shoes were only worn inside my home and never worn outside my home, this latest update will not deter me from purchasing these most comfortable shoes however it will be a disappointment as far as how long they last, this is the only disappointment I have with this brand.",Grasshoppers Women's Jensen Twill Sliip On Shoes STONE,B0002MB9BK

"I bought this shoes because, of the good reviews. I wanted something light, comfortable, waterproof and keep my feet warm.  It's comfortable and light but there is absolutely no protection for your feet.  I was soooo disappointed, my feet was very, very cold and it felt like I have no shoes at all even though I was wearing very thick socks. I guess for what I paid for should not expected too much!",disappointed!!!,B0002MB9BK
"After reading the reviews here on Amazon and on a competitor's site, it sounded like these would be perfect walking shoes for my upcoming trip abroad. When they arrived, I was pleased with the softness of the upper, and the slight stretchiness conformed to the foot nicely. However, the size of the sole was off; I usually wear an 11, and ordered an 11W to allow for thick socks, but the sole was at least 1/2"" too long, and 1/4"" too narrow, which dug into the sides of my feet. Perhaps because of the slight heel, the shoe didn't want to stay on, letting my heel slip up with every step and causing irritation after only a few minutes even with socks. The shaft hugged the ankle nicely, due to the slight stretch, but the upper edge flared out strangely, even more strangely considering my larger-than-average calves.

If you have a longer, narrower foot, these may work for you, but mine were sent back right away in pursuit of a better walking boot.",Better in theory,B0002MB9BK

I wear a set of keys outside my front pocket, every day, 5 days a week. The keys number about 20 and most sit outside the front pocket, moving every time I take a step. After a year, you cannot tell what side of my jeans I've worn the keys on, yet I wear them on the same side every time. Thats a tough test.

No wear on the knees, on the seat or at the crotch. No thinning anywhere. I think they last longer than the jeans I used to buy at The Gap and wore for the same purpose. Carhartts last. I have just a little color fade after a year, but I think they will still be in one piece after two years of solid, heavy use, occasionally crawling in and out of machinery, getting a workout.

The 6.5W were too big! I labeled these true to size since I've never actually tried a shoe in Wide before. The 6W fit like a glove and they are BEAUTIFUL! The braiding detail on the piece that wraps around the back of the heel is so pretty and the boots are a SOOOOFT buttery suede leather. They just reek of rich!! The shaft circumference is 15"".

I found the ankle a little baggy on me but my ankles are very slim for my size/height. I'm 5'10"" and the shaft hits about three inches below my knee.

"First of all I wanted to get the $199 moss/brown variation in size 8 B(M), which is my typical size. To me, the picture of ""moss brown"" looked more brown than ""dark brown nubuck"". Long story short, in a moment of weakness, due to availability and a whopping $100+ discount, I ordered the 8.5 2A(N) in ""dark brown nubuck"", thinking at less than half price I'd just make them work. I consider my feet normal width so hoped I might be able to break them in. As for the half size up, sometimes in boots (especially Ariats) I can wear 8.5. I was very concerned about getting a reddish colored pair of boots though...

Well they arrived today, and I'm happy to report that the brown nubuck is a rich chocolate brown, just what I wanted. The two-tone colors of the boot remind me of a milk chocolate and dark chocolate color combo. The weird thing is, the 8.5Ns fit me perfectly. There's wiggle room in the toe area, which is fine, but the width does not feel narrow at all. I even had thick socks on. I don't know if this means an 8 would have felt wide, but just thought I'd share the information. They felt comfortable. I tried them on with thick leggings. They were snug in the calf but not suffocating. Zipper hardware is sturdy. Leather is beautiful... suede-like with darker leather accents. The boots felt well made and look expensive. The interior lining could have been nicer, but who cares. The heels are fashionably high, but not uncomfortably high.

Also, you can't really tell from the picture, but these actually look quite different than the Janey style.

"UPDATE:
These canvas double decker slip-on sneakers run small and are quite stiff. I tried both the black and navy pairs, and returned them.  If you buy the regular canvas slip ons, I suggest going 1/2 to 1 full size up and be prepared to break them in.

However, the jersey double decker slip-on sneakers (heather gray color, sold on a different page) run true to size and were so comfortable, with very little breaking-in time required.  If you buy the jersey slip ons, I suggest trying your normal size.

All of the double deckers I've tried on have more arch support than the similar-looking Keds ""crash back"" sneakers. I wore the jersey pair all night at a concert immediately after purchasing. The seams on the inside rubbed in a couple places (top of one foot, back of heels), but no blisters. Got a little sweaty in there, but I spy some Keds socks cut perfectly for these slip ons! I'll be careful to break them in properly - or more like build up a little more skin thickness in the achilles tendon area - before I expect them to go all day. Overall, they're just plain fun.

"Updated Review: Did they change the description recently to say ""men's""?? I eventually got a small sweatshirt, which is nice and normal in every way (except maybe the puffy sleeves, which aren't very warm). Then my partner bought me another small in a different color and.. Ugh. The 2nd small sweatshirt is very different: absurdly small neck hole, tighter shoulders or ? that makes the sleeves ride up my arms so that the wrist bands feel scratchy and too tight. I suppose for this price you sacrifice quality control.

There is no way any human body would fit in the small sweatshirt but have a neck the size of a small boy. It's not like a turtle neck, just very small and tight - ridiculous! So I removed the neck ribbing, and it looks like a new manufacturer spec'd the neck hole for the size WITH the ribbing, as the new ribbing-removed hole is the exact size of the hole of the first sweatshirt WITHOUT ribbing removed. Won't buy one again, and bummed that my new sweatshirt is now raggedy and can't be worn out of the house.
----
Looking again at the main page for this sweatshirt - it's apparently unisex. The model is a dummy after all. In any case, as a woman who normally wears between a medium and large shirt (have to go larger because of shoulders), I was surprised that the medium sweatshirt is MASSIVE. I should have ordered a small, but I was too enchanted by the softness and beautiful green color to send it back before wearing it. It is even more comfortable than I'd expected, but the sleeves are just too long, and the arm and body areas are huge. I get cold in it unless I wear a long sleeve shirt under it, due to air flow.",Beware: sizing is for (large) men + Updated Review,B0002NYVOG

""Long length"" is rather relative -- we needed to add three more links to this already longer-than-typical band. Our local jeweler only charged $3 for the matching links and the work.

"When I was 18 or 19 (I am now 24) I bought my first pair of these, kind of on accident.  I had wanted another pair of moccasins in the store I was at, but they didn't have my size, so I settled for these.  Best thing that could have happened. Every year (maybe 14-16 months) since I have bought a pair of these shoes (because I run them into the ground.  Literally. The soles fall off, the leather gets holes.  Not because of bad craftsmanship either, I just wear them that much.)  They are so soft, so comfortable.  And I always get a size down because they STRETCH.  I usually wear 8/8.5, so I get a 7/7.5.  One year I got an 8 and within two weeks they had stretched super huge to where they flopped around on my foot.  My mistake though (and they were still super comfy).  The deerskin is so malleable and thin and soft that after they are broken in (takes about a day) it feels as if nothing is on your foot.

I wear these every day, everywhere, for everything, but they are not meant to be in water- not even the rain.  That doesn't stop me from doing it, just know that if they get wet they'll do what lightly-treated leather does and get kinda stiff.  Also, kind of a funny anecdote:  I was once camping and had my feet resting up on the edge of the fire ring and the glue holding the sole on melted and the sole started peeling off (so don't put these near flames...obvious to the non-oblivious).  I quickly slammed my foot back down onto the sandy ground where the glue instantly hardened back to the sole, though it was a little misshapen.  Still wore them for another 7 months.

"So, after wanting a pair of ""fuzzy"" boots for years, but not wanting to pay bookoo $$$ for Uggs, I discovered Bearpaw. Where do I begin? These boots are sooo comfy! Great for wearing without socks. They keep your feet warm and dry but are not overly hot. Some other reviews I read said that they ran small, but I ordered a size 9 (I usually wear an 8 or 9 depending on the shoe) and they fit perfectly! I decided on the abigail style because I have large-ish calves and was worried about being able to get the boot on. This style is also great because I can easily tuck my boot cut jeans into it (I am not one of the privileged few who look good in skinny jeans). The sole is sturdier than it looks in the pictures. As for traction, this style doesn't look like it would be that safe to wear on icy days, but I haven't tried it out yet. Probably better for going to the mall than shoveling your driveway. Anyway, I ordered black (because it goes with everything!) but can definitely see myself ordering more colors in the future!

I had to were these shoes every day, 6 hours a day, for a week. Then, I had to wear them in our 4 performances. As soon as I would get off stage, I would just stop and rip them off quick!

"This is a beautiful watch and a great price but I wish I would have paid attention to the dimensions. I have a small wrist, but the watch face was a little too petite for my taste. However, the band size was a little large which could have been corrected by removing one of the clasps, but I couldn't ever undo the clasp. It was very difficult to release the clasp.

The only problem I have with it is that the clasp is extremely difficult to undo.  I struggle with it every time I want to take the watch off.  I am concerned that the amount of pulling I have to do will weaken the links/clasp, not to mention that it's just plain frustrating trying to get the thing off.

When I got these boots (a little later than I anticipated), I was slightly disappointed with the look and quality as compared with the online picture.  When I laced the boots, I was a little more disappointed.  And when I tried them on, I was even more disappointed.  The sole was comfortable, but the rest of the boot, especially the top crease, was extremely uncomfortable.  I would say that they were true to size (I wear a 13), but they just weren't comfortable at all, and I wasn't wowed like I expected to be.  Overall, I just wasn't impressed.

Got this one as it was exactly what she wanted. Has numbers and a white face. Nice stainless steel mesh band. My wife is very happy. FYI, these watches cost literally more than twice as much at Macy's and cost less here than similar ones at Costco, which is also a good bet to buy from but usualy ony carry one or two styles. But Amazon's selection was the best, by far, seriously, of anybody's.

I love Amazon as they always ship quicker than they say they will. Maybe it's because we're in LA and I think they have a facility here. But nonetheless it's great that they beat their own time frame. (I am not a stooge for Amazon, just a satisfied customer).",Wife loves it.,B0002UD438

Skagen makes women's watches with large dials and others with very small ones. There aren't many in between. This one is small enough to look good on my small wrist but large enough to read easily.

the crystal is very clear and the face is easy to read, there is no second hand though, if that concerns you.

"Got this boots for my wife, those boots are actually a rebranded Demonia 815 style. Due to the nature of the boots, they are very heavy. The quality is not the best, and boots are not real leather, but it has killer looks. Boots are back-zip. Very easry to put them on

-Pros
Cheap.
Not leather (if you are into ""dont kill the animals"")
Awesome looks.
Not as heavy as real leather, but still heavy.

Cons:
a little too tight. might not be a good idea to put them with jeans, the zipper might break.
Zipper might not last long. if you have used New Rock boots you will be disappointed with the back zipper.

"I decided to go through all my shoes and writes reviews for them...so hope I help!

I've worn and loved these for around 4/5 years..they're sturdy as all-get-out. The straps on the front allow me to make sure they fit snug around my leg/ ankle which is a HUGE plus and the only reason I was actually able to buy these...Adult shoes companies do not make shoes in my size so if I want something like this I HAVE to have straps or laces. They feel great for a platform, they're one of the more comfortable of all the Demonia's I own.

After reading another review (the 2 star)...I was confused as to WTF the person was saying about falling off/or out of them...because I've never fell once. (unlike several of the other Demonia's I have.)
I should be a prime candidate to fall in these, I actually wear a size 2/3 shoe..but the pair I have in these are a size 6, I'm super clumsy, I'm a heavy drinker and I go dancing..not to mention I live in the south and most bar parking lots are gravel where I am!

The only thing I can think of they could have been referring to is the bottoms falling through.. after 4/5 years I've not had this issue. They're still as sturdy as ever. The bottoms are SOLID after-all, it's not like they're hollow. They also don't get heavy because the material is still light weight. I've worn them in rain and snow and after a good cleaning you'd never known they'd been worn. They're not ""soft"" or ""floppy"" at all. They're a nice solid shoe..yet still the material the bottoms are made of still are easy on the feet for the most part. =)

They do fit like a second skin, (if you want them too, they ARE adujustable to fit the ankle/leg) your foot doesn't move around or anything...so unless you just have bad luck or get outrageously fit-saced you're not going to fall down..and even then it's not because of the shoe it's because you're out of it. LOL

I'm pretty sure that poster was one of those stupid paid reviewers trying to get you to buy that other brand I've never heard of...So, I'd really just disregard that entire post. It seems they just looked at the shoe and wrote what they ""thought"" might happen in such a shoe.

I think you'll all be just fine in them. =)  My best friend has a pair she bought after seeing mine about 4 years ago, and she feels the same as I do about these. =)

These will draw alot of attention, and compliments..so if you're antisocial it's a bit annoying at times. =P",5 Year and Still Loving them!,B0002UU36E

"These boots seem to be very well made, and I have yet to slip on ice due to the super grippy soles.  Of course, they look awesome.

However, I bought the smallest size that Demonia makes (6), and they are too big all around.  I'm generally a size 6, sometimes 5 1/2, but these feel closer to a 7 or 8 (I can't make my toes touch the end even if I try).  Also, the boots stay up because they are stiff, but they are also loose on my calves and ankles.

"I absolutely adore these boots. People compliment me on them all the time. I wear them with long skirts and they look amazing. The reason I can't provide the product 5 stars is the fact that after about one year of wearing them (albeit I wore them constantly), the contact between the heel of the upper and the sole separated. I took them to a shoe repair store but was told that the only thing to do was use glue, and unfortunately that solution didn't last long. I am now buying a second pair to replace the first. However, the fact that I'm willing to keep buying these boots shows they got me hooked!",Gets compliments,B0002UTZGS

"I love boots and have quite a collection. These boots look nice, but everything ends there. These are so uncomfortable to walk in. I've had heels which are more friendly on my feet. These pinch and slide in all the wrong places","Cute, but uncomfortable",B0002UTZGS
"I love these boots and bought them to be my comfy every day boots. But while the foot of these boots fit great the legs didn't fit the calf shaping started 1"" lower than my own and cut in so badly at the top it hurt( even with the elastic built in). I spend $40 to get them stretched twice before I could even get them zipped comfortably!! So sad designers need to realize the bigger the foot the longer the leg... so on",frustrated,B0002UTZGS
"I purchased this pair of boots after reading the couple of reviews here.  I am typically a size 10, and decided to go with size 10 since I have purchased Pleasers before in this size with no problems.

Well, when I received them, they looked fantastic and were going to replace another pair of boots.  When I tried them on, my foot fit perfectly, but as I started to zip, I realized they were going to be too tight in the calves!  I was trying them on barefoot, no pantyhose or leggings, and they were impossibly too tight there.  I was shocked, since I have never had this problem with boots, and since I loved these so much, I decided to keep them and try to make it work with Shoe Stretch.  I don't think it worked, since I wasn't able to zip them up to even try stretching them out.

I fully expecting them to be loose in the calves, as a review here suggested, but they must be sized pretty irregularly, or my calves are just too big for these.  This would make sense, except that I own several pairs of boots and have recently bought more, and never have this issue.  One thing about them that I noticed is the stretchy adjustment triangle strip near the zipper is shorter than on other pairs of boots, so they only start stretching far up.  Nevertheless, I've decided to try some compression pantyhose and the Shoe Stretch again - if I manage to squeeze into them, I'll just wear them until they break in.  In any case, it's a lot of headache to go through for a pair of boots!

Anyway, my recommendation is, if you like the look of these shoes, try them on in the store or be prepared to possibly return them.",Look amazing but tight in the calves!,B0002UTZGS
"These boots are cool looking. My only complaint about these boots is they are super tight around the ankle. I am fairly slender with skinny ankles, if anything I usually have problems with boots being too big - however I have to wear a thick pair of wool socks with these boots so they don't rub on my ankles when I dance or walk. I'd hoped wearing the thick socks would stretch them eventually but no dice - they are cut too tight. I imagine they'd be very uncomfortable for girls with largish ankles or lower legs.",Stylish - But tight on the ankles,B0002UTZGS
"Love that these come in WIDE.  It is tough to locate those for little kids wide feet.  My son started taking tap and is having a grand time making noise with these.

"The Capezio shoes arrived late from Amazon, why did I pay for express shipping?

That being said, the shoes themselves are of decent quality. Other reviewers of dance shoes have mentioned the need to size ""up"", I wear size 14 and they fit fine.

"This is not the first time I use the Capezio brand. These are some of the best shoes out there. I also already owned a pair of the normal leather ones and can say that these shoes are made of great quality and last a long time. However, I got the black patent ones for the first time and was disappointed. They were the same size as the other pair I had. But it was really hard to fit my feet inside. I redid the lacing, tried leather stretching techniques, and still found them uncomfortable. I still was able to use them for a competition. I figure that they will stretch enough eventually. But I think nobody should have to go through my pain. I recommend ordering half a size larger for the patent ones.","Bad Fit, Great Quality",B0002UVL42

"The workmanship of these shoes is fantastic, great soft leather, stitching is superb and the soles are very smooth.

"Everyone's foot is obviously different, because these shoes fit me perfectly (I wear a size 13-M).  I was a bit concerned about buying them online without having tried a pair on first, but that concern proved to be unwarranted.

I thought the Amazon price was good, as I'd seen the shoes elsewhere for upwards of $100.  My girlfriend ""roped"" me into taking swing dance lessons, and I didn't want to invest a lot of money in dance shoes I may never use again.

These are an excellent fit although I might have bought a half size larger if I had know how close a fit they are.  They fit well and the shaft snuggly, but not uncomfortably, fits my leg.

"I know platform boots of this style look intimidating but they're surprisingly comfortable to wear.  I wear mine all day long.  Pleaser brand has never let me down.  They're a true-to-size fit, affordable, and are quality boots.  The only bad thing I'd say is that the shaft width is too small.  If a person has muscular or fatter calves the boots won't fit.  Most seem to only give a 13-14 inch diameter.  Larger women like me would fare better with a 17 inch opening but even with the laces spread they won't fit.  Especially buckled boots, I've returned many adorable boots with buckles on account of my larger calves.

That's my only negative statement, I wish Pleaser would make the Electra foot style with larger calves.  This particular model is the only one that fits because it's shorter in height.

"I'm normally a size 7.5. I got these in 7 and they still felt a little loose in the actual foot of the shoe (not uncomfortably so, just not tight like I would expect form going half a size down from my normal size!)

I also was sort of expecting them to be super tight at the thigh. I have rather full muscular thighs and smaller calves, but they actually are awesomely snug!

Takes forever to put on (full lace-up + 3 buckles that have several loopholes) but they're gorgeous and pretty comfortable and due to their snugness, you don't have to worry too much about the discomfort of walking on 5"" stilettos since you get all the ankle support you need.

"I rode the Electra 3028 thigh-high boot some eight miles on a bicycle, and they are solid! I thought surely the chunk heel would come off after grinding pavement in city street traffic, but only the thick rubber soles were gouged or nicked at ride end. Btw, I live in a city where theatrics, like wearing sexy red boots, is all a part of keeping it weird. Now, I have a narrow, size 9, men's foot (4 inches at the widest) and bought the size 11 women's boot; it's very, VERY snug. (Do women really torture their feet in this way to be attractive?) My biker leg fit fine (calf size 13.5 inches); the pinch really comes at the ankle and toes. Where I was surprised it did not pinch was at the knee; I rode rather comfortably without restriction of motion. As for the design of the Electra 3028, its truly rebellous - from the buckles to the zipper to the amazingly-crafted chunk heel. Red and black laces both come with the product. If you wear these boots in the outdoors and are exerting yourself like bicycling or chopping wood, then I definitly recommend weather in the 20s to the 30s because these boots are not only hot, but temperature-hot!

The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that after walking a while, I had a lot of pain in my ankles and a blister or two. Because of their material and style, they don't bend well at the ankle and the heel (not the height, but the part that the back of your foot rests against) is very rigid.

"I love these boots. My mother brought a pair back from Australia about 5 years ago and I thought they were so ugly. I finally broke down and bought a pair after listening to her brag about how warm they were - my feet are always freezing. Well, they keep my feet warm and are soft and cozy. I wear my pants over them and no one seems to really notice that I'm wearing boots all the time. I wish I had a second pair to wear around the house.",Love these boots,B0002ZCBKA
"Both my daughters love these boots - take the word boot lightly, though. They are not waterproof and a good wet weather winter boot. They are casual wear. Nordstom's has em for about 150. As fo being made in china - yup, most Uggs are. The EMU Uggs are made in Australia, and, thee are a few online sellers. From what I have seen they are actually a bit less money.",much less elsewhere,B0002ZCBKA
"For me the advertising on this product is misleading. It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them. The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you, as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality. This is a very expensive boot but it's badly  constructed. Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased. The name is what your paying for, this is not a top end elegant product,it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality. This is unfortunate because at one time, years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it, now it's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity. Thats my opinion and I'm stuck with it.",Made in China,B0002ZCBKA
"OMG these are the best boots i have ever bought!! they are so warm and comfortable .. i cant explain in words how fantastic they are!! I only wish that i jumped on the ""ugg""ly boot bandwagon last year!! I got the Chocolate, mainly because i know that the sand can stain easier and i personally prefer darker shoes. I am so happy with my purchase i think i might be getting some family members a pair for the holiday! i do agree to order one size smaller, i was hesitant, because i have large feet (10) but the 9 fits like a glove.
you will not regret this purchase!!",i wish i didn't wait so long to buy these :),B0002ZCBKA
The product came exactly as described and came quickly. I would definitely order from them again!,Quick Shipping! Awesome Product!,B0002ZCBKA
"great boots, but as previous poster said, the black will dye your feet! also, they fit big; i bought 7s but i am wondering if i should have bought 6s. i haven't tried the 6s so i'm not sure. it's too bad they don't have half sizes.
also, if your feet are ladies size 8 or smaller, it is cheaper to buy the children's uggs! (only thought of this after i bought mine.)
all in all, great boots. i'm glad i bought them.",ugg women's classic tall in black,B0002ZCBKA
i've owned a pair of these for 6 years now.  they are still going strong and i wear them everyday.  i have taken these boots from jungle terrain to salt water and they are still going strong.  the only thing i have ever had to do to them is have them re-soled.  everything else on them is perfect.,best boots i ever had,B0002ZYV7G

"I first bought these boots around August 1995, I had them until June 2007. I discard them not because they were worn out or broken, but because I separated from the US ARMY. I loved every minute I used them, they were very comfortable, plus I always got great comments and they looked great with my formal uniform, but of course I know how to do a great ""spit shine"" .

Disclaimer - I was an Enlisted Surgical Assistant that worked in the hospital all day and I had to change into scrubs with tennis shoes. The amount of wear I gave the boots it would be the same as someone that would use them all day in normal work settings for about 5 years.

These boot are NOT meant to be used in rough settings like camping or any outdoor activity, like a field unit or hiking. These boot are meant for light work, like in an office or for military special functions like parades.

I would not recommend them for cold weather (32F or less), the mesh on the side will let the cold right in.

I DO NOT recommend these boots for non-military personnel NOR for military personnel that never had to do a ""spit shine"" before. You know, those military guys that wear the tan boots from the moment they joined because it's too much work to ""spit shine"". Like my son and his buddies .

Don't think about it twice, buy them already they are great.",I loved every minute I used them,B0002ZYV7G
best boots I have ever worn in my life. My first pair lasted my from 2001-2015. I was in high school when I bought my first pair.

"I am a huge Nike fan. I bought these because I had a pair of Nike slip on one piece sandals. After about 2 weeks the side inserts popped off and the top piece securing my foot was loose. I tried to glue it back together, but nothing seemed to work. As a result, I am still looking for a really decent pair of Nike sandals that are one solid piece (without tabs holding the sole and top together). Nike made an awesome pair several years ago, but I am unable to find them....miss those. I guess I should have bought 10 pairs when I had the chance.",Disappointed,B00031U8U8

I really like that I can buy wranglers for my baby boys, they are great, durable, long lasting jeans that always fit well.  And they can match dad in their cowboy pants.  The only thing I didn't like about the purchase was that they are a little expensive for such a small pair of pants, you can buy adult mens wranglers for only a few dollars more then these size 3T's.","great jeans, a little spendy",B0008JFA9O
"I ordered these on Amazon because I found out at the last minute that my son needed black pants for his play as his part changed to that of the penguin, lol!  I didn't have time to run out to target to buy a pair, which is where I normally get all his jeans.

The jeans arrived and I threw them in the washing machine on the light agitation/cold water setting so that my son could wear them on the following day for the play.

The button fell off in the wash!  I know that 5 year old boys can be hard on jeans, so I don't set the bar too high for endurance, but falling apart before he has even worn them is a new low!

"Buying shoes to fit my son's foot is difficult.  He has far fewer choices when buying gym shoes, but almost no choices when buying cleats.  He didn't wear cleats in soccer until he was 5 because of this.  We felt the need to buy them at that point because all of the other teammates had them.  After searching high and low, we found some.  Dicks sporting goods helped me to order his first pair.  I went back to Dick's to order another pair, and they quit offering them.  I thought Zephz were gone until I found them on Amazon.com.  So, my son is wearing his 2nd pair of Zephz.  His size 1 wide pair lasted through fall/spring soccer.  The toe of the shoe wore out, but they were getting to be too tight anyways.  We've tried other cleats that claim to be for wider fitting feet, but he refused to wear them because of how they felt.  I ordered him size 2 wide and he preferred those over a pair of Nike T90's that we had bought.  So I kept the Zephz and returned the Nike shoes.  They're perfect for my 6 year-olds needs.  I imagine I'll be ordering a 3 wide this time next year.  I hope they'll come out with a baseball and football cleat as well.",Finally... wide width cleats,B0009QVFT0

"Almost every day I take my dogs to the open space.  I usually wear my super-comfy Nike tennis shoes, but on rainy days or when the tall wild grass is wet with dew, my shoes, socks, and feet get soaking wet.

So I went on a mission to find some waterproof shoes.  I first tried out a pair of waterproof rain boots.  They were stylish and fully waterproof, but more appropriate for a fashionable day at the office than an hour of walking in uneven terrain.  I found them too uncomfortable for practical use and returned them.

Next I bought a pair of duck boots.  That was probably overkill but that's all I could find at the local store.  They were nicely cushioned and again, waterproof but so heavy and bulky that they aggravated my slipped disk.  I actually pulled a muscle wearing those shoes.  So I stopped wearing them after just a few outings.

When I read about the Merrell Mocs, I was intrigued.  Based on another review here, I ordered a kids size 5 and it fit my womens size 6.5 perfectly.  Even in my thick wool socks.  And the mocs are delightful.  They are super lightweight, well contoured to my feet, easy to slip on and take off, and incredibly comfortable.  AND they're water-resistant.  Not ""waterproof"" but they're enough to keep my feet completely dry when I sludge in the wet grass for an hour.  Plus they look good.  I can see the more muted colors even being nice enough for an office environment.

One very minor thing about these shoes is that the inside arch has this support that I wasn't used to.  It's not uncomfortable in any way, just not what I'm used to.  I do walk funny, so it's possible that others won't even notice this.

I'm tempted to buy another pair just in case something happens to the one I have.  I love these shoes that much!",Fantastic Water-Resistant Shoes & They Fit Women's Sizes,B000B2HVMW
"These mocs are standard wear for school uniform.  However, they're sizing is inconsistent.  My child outgrew a size 1 so we ordered a size 1.5.  However, when we put the old and new shoes side by side, the pairs were the same length.  So now I have to exchange for a size 2 (which we tried on at Nordstroms the other day and was way too large that you could not even make it work with padding!!!)  I am hoping that what the seller can send me a ""smaller"" size 2.","Great shoes, inconsistent sizing",B000B2HVMW

"My 7 yr old liked it. However, the indigo light only worked for a few weeks. I changed the battery to see if that was the issue and it wasnt. The rubber gasket, which makes this waterproof, is slightly too large, and the channel its supposed to fit into is very shallow, so I wasn't able to get it placed well enough to make it seal properly. So, basically, no light, no waterproof, and also the buttons are hard to press.

Overall, typical cheap junk. Now searching for a replacement.",Cheap. Light only lasted a few weeks. Rubber gasket is difficult to get back in place,B000B5256G

"I bought this brand / style of tights for my daughter when she started dance class at 3 years old. Back then, she wore the Toddler size. I love these tights so much that every time she outgrows a pair, I simply buy the same brand / style in the next bigger size. She's gone through sizes Toddler, Small, and Intermediate, and we're now on Medium. The sizes seem to run true-to-size. My daughter is currently a size 8, and the Medium (8-10) fits perfectly.

These tights are super soft and stretchy, and my daughter has been able to put them on all by herself since she was 6 years old, wearing size Intermediate (6X/7). (Back then, she had trouble putting on ""regular"" tights by herself, I guess because they're usually not as stretchy.)

None of my daughter's tights have ever ripped. I think the Toddler or the Small got a small ""blemish"" (a little discoloration, and the material felt thinner in that area) from when my daughter fell on her knee, but it never opened up into a run or a hole. Her current tights do have a couple snags in them around the knees, but again, they haven't opened up into runs or holes. Overall, I am very satisfied with the quality.

As an aside, I'll mention that one year, when I hadn't bought these tights yet, the salesperson who sold us ballet shoes talked me into buying Capezio 100% Nylon tights. (I think the store only carried Capezio brand tights.) After a few weeks of classes, both my daughter and I found we didn't really like them, compared to the Danskin UltraSoft Microfiber tights. They weren't very stretchy, so they were difficult to put on, and within a couple weeks, they had several snags. I quickly switched back to our trusted brand and style. I know this isn't the place to review OTHER tights, but just having that experience actually made me appreciate these tights even more.",Great Tights,B000B5U75C

I've bought these tights 3 times for my daughter to use in her 3/4 year old ballet class. After picking and running all 3 pairs with once a week use (usually on the 2nd or 3rd wear) I've resorted to buying the 1.99 tights at target and wouldn't you know it... they hold up.

"Excited for my daughter to wear aesthetically pleasing and functionally well thought out pair of rain boots this Spring. The ease of keeping her sneaker's on, clean, and dry going to school appealed to me. I got a size bigger to compensate for the ""putting on and taking off"" with her shoes on. The velcro fastener is easy to use and secure. BUT! Manufacturing quality is very effed up. Worst, is that it's made here in our very own United States of America. These boots are why companies are going overseas. Overpaid, entitled American workers throw products to consumers without the care and pride that our parents generation of factory workers had. Maybe I just got that mistake pair that was bypassed by the factory workers and quality control. Maybe my pair happens to be dumpster rejects bought by a shady retail company looking only to throw cash in their pockets without the morals of a real business. Maybe I'm overreacting to rubber rain boots that will only fit my daughter for only one of many spring seasons of her life. Maybe if grandma had balls, she'd be grandpa.

All in all, the owners, inventors and designers of these boots had the right idea and track, the people making them... Screwed it up. Flashing everywhere and a short shot on the bottom front of the sole. Really came down to the manufacturing. This boot deserves to be made with 100% real American pride and quality. Be aware future buyer. Don't perpetuate poor quality American products just because they're made in the USA. Buy them if they're great American products.",Made in USA... poorly.,B000BH0372

I ordered three of these things for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves them. Two months ago she switched from wearing thongs to wearing boy cut panties because she said they were more comfortable.

"With low rise (or butt crack of dawn) jeans so popular, this type of thong has almost gone the way of the dinosaur. They are very hard to find.  So, I was extremely pleased to see them here on Amazon.  I prefer the higher waist style, they just fit more comfortably up over the hip, and lay smoothly.  They don't roll down as I've had some thongs do.

My philosophy has always been:  If da undies ain't comfy, inta da garbage they go!!  I hate to admit how many new thongs I've thrown out over the years because they were uncomfortable. When I found a thong brand that worked well for me, I stuck with it.  Little by little over the years, my options kept dwindling until I found the Elita brand.

I love this brand.  It's the best I've come across and I will definately be purchasing more, just on the off chance they ever discontinue them.  I'll be the little old lady hoarder with the stockpile of them, but at least I'll be comfy during my golden years!  :)

I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.

2. They are very lightweight. I expected them to be heavy. You can fold the top half down to make room in closet or when carrying them around.

3. If you are blessed with having muscular calves as I do, they can be a bit of a pain to get on as any knee-high boot would. You WILL have to untie and loosen the laces and undo 3 of the 4 latches to get them on and zipped up all the way. The tongue needs to held in place with a free hand while zipping the closure.

4. The platform and heel make a sturdy base so you can strut your stuff with confidence, but I'd still be extrra careful when dealing with stairs or driving a car. The platform is a little over 2 inches and may throw you off when climbing stairs or driving.

5. They look great with a skirt that shows them in all their glory, or you can wear them with jeans so make them your little ""cool"" secret.

You don't need to be ""goth"" or ""punk"" to own these shoes. They'll look great on any chick with the attitude to wear them. ;)",Excellent price for cool-looking shoes,B0002UU1OS
"I usually love demonic boots, and this would have been my 3rd or 4th pair. They came very fast,  very pleased there BUT while I usually wear a 6-6.5, I bought these as a 7 because I know they run small. Unfortunately the shaft  was too small for my muscular calves regardless. Luckily they fit my much smaller sister-in-law and she likes them.","Fast shipping, runs small",B0002UU1OS
"The elastic laces alone make this completely worth it.  It's very easy to slip right on.  After my daughter's last pair of sneakers (they were pulled off at every opportunity and I had to constantly untie and then retie her shoes), these has been a dream!  She loves her pink shoes and is starting to be able to put them on herself with a little help.

The quality is really great and the sizing seemed just right,",Great shoe with little toddlers in mind,B000EJ0MA0

"My daughter is 4 1/2, but is moving out of a 5T in her clothes, and the S/M fits well and will for a while.  It is not baggy, but we don't have to struggle to get them on.  They look great.  I sent her in these tights to gymnastics camp, where they were supposed to have a Superhero Costume Contest on arrival and then change into normal wear.  When I picked her up at 6:00 p.m., she was still wearing the tights and they didn't have a snag or tear on them.  My daughter is extremely rough so these are very well-made.  I definitely would purchase again.","Fabulous Quality, and they look great",B000ENT6PS
"These are great tights. Some of the other (cheaper) brands do not hold up to these.  The others tear just trying to get them on!
As for SIZE.  I have been dancing since the age of 6 and after retiring as a professional dancer, opened my own school.  Parents
too often make the mistake of buying dancewear TOO SMALL because they don't understand how it is worn and its purpose.
In the case of tights, I ALWAYS buy UP in size.  And when looking at sizing charts pay more attention to height than weight.
A tight needs to fit the length of the dancer's leg and still have room to stretch when she does a kick, plie (bend at the knee), or a split!
In addition, from the crotch to the waist should definitely cover the belly button or they will always feel like they are falling off.",BUY UP A SIZE,B000ENT6PS
These stocking fitted perfectly and they had enough stretch.  This size is perfect for someone who wears a size 5 in clothing.  It looked great on my daughter for her recital. Was very please with the product.,Perfect fit,B000ENT6PS
"I bought these tights for my 5 yo daughter for her dance recital. Even though it says 4 - 7, these tights were to small for my 5 yo. Meanwhile I should say that my daughter is 46 in. tall, which is pretty tall for her age, but still 7 is a quite an exaggeration. I ended up buying the bigger size and giving the ones I bought to a smaller classmate of my daughter. And they were really happy with the quality of the tights. They survived several dress rehearsals and recital as well.
So I would recommend these tights.","Danskin Girls 2-6x Fishnet Tight,Black,S/I (4-7)",B000ENT6PS
"I got this product for my daughter, because these tights were required for her dance recital costume. There are size charts given for the product on Amazon, so I purchased this based on the chart's sizing information.  My daughter is petite and well within the measurements given for this size, and is 20 pounds less than the maximum weight for them, but they barely fit her.  Barely.  So if you're ordering these, it might be a good idea to go with the next size up from what you think you need.",Sizing issues,B000ENT6PS

"I wanted to love these shoes. They're sturdy and comfortable, they don't show dirt, and even though they're marketed as ""boys'"" shoes, they looked cute with my daughter's summer outfits. They stood up to repeated soakings in her wading pool and dried out overnight each time.

However:
Even though we received size 8, the shoe fit more like a 7.5 and my daughter outgrew it well before the other Stride Rite size 8 shoes we ordered at the same time.  Also, we chose these shoes because of the toe protection, but on the outer side the gap between the straps left my daughter's littlest toe exposed. Her toe would often stick out completely, so we ended up having to use socks, which defeats the convenience factor of sandals in the first place.

If the strap gap flaw were fixed and the sizing standardized, then I would recommend these shoes.",Runs small; baby toe not protected,B000FIJVR0

"I initially loved this shoe as I thought it was good quality, comfortable, and had good traction. The upper material is supposedly leather while the sole is man-made material - this is very common and I never have problems with shoes made of such materials myself. After a few weeks of wearing it, however, my toddler's feet stunk like you wouldn't believe. This happens with man-made material shoes that do not let feet breathe, and I have stopped buying them for myself long ago (except Crocs, which are anti-bacterial and anti-odor and so usually last pretty long until they need a wash) and certainly would not buy them for my child. So the stinky feet was a surprise, as this is supposed to have leather AND holes to let my child's feet breathe. Meanwhile, my son had been wearing another pair of Stride Rite sneakers everyday for almost a year and they do NOT smell at all. Won't be buying this particular style again - the odor is too embarrassing!",Makes stinky feet!,B000FIJVR0

"Stride Rite's Austin athletic shoe is a well made and versatile shoe.

The quality of the leather is nice, and the stitching is strong throughout the shoe. It has a heavy dute sole that should wear well for quite a while, even for an active child.

The shoe itself is heavy, not like an ultra light sneaker (which most kids probably don't wear anyway).

Note - there is little padding on the inside of the shoe, which may or may not make a difference depending on your child's foot.

This shoe comes in W & XW sizes.

Another great thing about this shoe is that it's gender neutral, so a boy or girl could wear it.

I love Stride Rite's quality and versatility in the Austin athletic shoe.

I won't buy this style again, because honestly, I ordered one in every size. With the sales/discounts it was about $13 per pair, and I can easily sell used pairs for this much at the consignment shop.",Stride Rite quality for boys or girls,B000FIK09S

I don't remember if they said they are steel-toed boots in the description, but they sure feel that way.  The ankle is high enough to provide support against rolling, but not too high to rub on his leg above his socks.  They keep his feet comfortable all day long.  I would highly recommend these boots.  We have always bought Timberland boots and he went above the $50 size and no way was I going to pay $70 for a pair of boots he would only fit into for 1 summer!  These are a great value for the money.  Also - the sole is nice and thick so if he happened to step on anything it won't go through the bottom of the boot.",Great kids work boots!,B000GC7FSM

With no means to tighten it, I had to return it.  I got a different style of shoe for him in the same size and brand (OshKosh), and they fit perfectly.

"My son is 4, 38lbs, and 41"" tall, so I consider him slim.  I ordered him a 2/3T, which fit him PERFECT.  So if your little man is slim/avg, I would suggest one size down then they wear in pants for the perfect fit, or reg size to grow a bit.

My ONLY complaint is the elastic waistband.  My son has been potty trained for 2 1/2 years, but when he rushes out of the bathroom, the waistband tends to stay a tad rolled (don't ask how he accomplishes this, LOL).

"I have previously bought this Hanes underwear, in Hipster size 2-3. My 3.5 daughter, who is thin (with an ""athletic rear"") is swimming in brief underwear. So I tried the hipsters. They were pretty decent. They stayed in place, not too much fabric, decently comfortable, etc. So now that they are getting a hint small, we tried size 4. Please see the pictures below:

1) The turquoise underwear are Hanes Bikini in size 4 along with the package of assorted colors I received
2) The Bikini size 4, over the yellow Hanes Hipsters in size 4. You can see the cut difference between the Bikini and the Hipster.
3) The white underwear is the Hanes Hipster in a size 2-3 - so you can see the difference between the size 2-3 and size 4 underneath. Also when you compare photos, you can see that the Hipster size 2-3 is similar in cut to the Bikini size 4. The main difference is that the waist on the Bikini size 4 is bigger than the Hipster size 2-3. But other than that they are cut pretty similarly.

I was also worried that the Bikini style would not be ""appropriate"" for a 3.5 year old.  However, it looks totally appropriate.  Everything is modestly covered and the sides are not too small.  Moreover, because she is thin, the bikini just fits her body better without the excess material.

Colors: I received an assortment with a turquoise theme.  No pinks, purples, reds, etc.  So be aware that you may get a color scheme that your daughter doesn't like, and if so, be prepared to return it.  Luckily my daughter liked the turquoise theme.

To sum up: My thin/skinny daughter is in between the Hipster size 2-3 and size 4. And because of it, the Bikini size 4 fits her much better. Is this expensive, beautiful underwear? Nope. But is this decent material, with a decent cut, with no tags, that doesn't ride up, and that will last a year? Yup. And at basically $1 per underwear, it is perfectly priced for what it is. I hope this is helpful to you!

UPDATE: so I am not sure if my daughter had a growth spurt in 3 weeks, but all of a sudden these underwear aren't quite big enough.  They are wide enough, but as I mentioned before, she has an ""athletic rear"" and they when she moves around a lot sometimes they move down a bit.  So, here are my updated thoughts: if your daughter is thin with an ""athletic rear"", get the hipsters.  But if she has a flatter rear, then get these.  :)","Comparing the Hanes ""hipster"" and ""bikini"" little girls underwear",B000J429LU

"I'm over 50 but have kid-sized feet, so I bought myself a pair to keep dry on rainy/snowy days. I would say they work like a charm, but my right leg ended up in a cast before I got them, so technically I've only worn one of them. It has certainly kept my one foot clean and dry. It's well-formeds and looks decent with pants and dresses, believe it or not! It's strong but flexible enough to be comfortable. I'm buying my teenage daugher a pair next, only she'll get the pink ones. Once the rubber smell vanishes for good, I may upgrade them to five stars.","Nice, practical boots",B000J4B3TE
Barely 2 months old and seldom worn and the material is splitting and cracking as if the rubber material is defective. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,Kamik Stomp Rain Boot,B000J4B3TE
"I bought these for my son after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, they are not a good fit for us. The left boot is always leaking water to the inside. Maybe it is defective. Then I put them over the floor heater grate to dry them out (they were not drying out on their own) and it warped the top of one of the boots. We have bought Hatley boots in the past and always put them over the heater grate and they were always fine. Guess I will be sticking with Hatley.",Wet!,B000J4B3TE
"Great looking boot but they run small.  My son is a toddler size 9, I ordered these boots in a 10.  They fit him with bare feet but not with socks.  Disappointing.",Runs small,B000J4B3TE
I ordered these boots in size 6 (toddler) for my 18 months old son but as another reviewer said they are not toddler size-it came 6 youth size( probably I could squeeze my feet in it). Anyway they are going back I can't wait until he is 5 or 6 years old to wear those. On the positive side they seem much lighter then regular rain boots and looked well made for the money.,"Beware-Size is youth not toddler, boots are good quality though",B000J4B3TE
"These will hold up for sure more than the cheap ones you see at local walmarts and Target.
they really stink from the vinyl/pvc when they first come out of the box however.
 you get what you pay for,and these to me are worth spending 10 bucks or more than the cheaper brands. true to size. I am not a fan of PVC/VINYL but they are for rain..","Great shoes,but stinky from the material",B000J4B3TE
"Very good boot - goes on easily and stays on, unlike some rain boots. Good flexible shape to them, and good grip on the sole - my 20 month old hasn't fallen over in them so far!, and he's comfortable walking in them for hours. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that they size up a little small, and even though I got a size larger than his current shoe size in the hopes of making them last a while (with some extra socks), they won't last through the spring I fear.
From what I've seen (with kids AND adults sizings), rain boots vary greatly in size depending on the manufacturer - so if you're worried about spending money on things like this, it might be best to go to a shop where you can try a few on.",Great Boots,B000J4B3TE
These boots were perfect for my 8 year old son.  He loves them.  Well made and quality is very good for the price.,Good value,B000J4B3TE

"This watch arrived with a dead battery.  A few attempts to change it resulted only in scuffing the plastic back, so now it is a dead watch with gouged plastic.  No useful instructions come with it.","Battery Dead, and impossible to change",B000JNS97Y
"I bought this watch for a 6 year old boy but ended up keeping it for myself, far away from being a kid. I love it. It's adorable, bright and cheerful, playful and a treat to wear. It is comfortable too. It appears to be very good quality, although I am a bit concerned about the clasp. I'm thrilled with the watch!",Not for kids only,B000JNS97Y
"I just bought this for my husband's birthday and he loves it.  Loves the fact that he can change the colors, loves the compliments he gets on it, loves that he got to build it.

Seems sturdy enough, although we're talking about a ""kid"" who isn't that rough and tumble.

Doesn't glow in the dark, the tick part isn't that loud (his last watch was like a sonic boom in comparison), there are about 4 pieces per color, and three different watch circles (yellow, red and blue).",cool even for adults,B000JNS97Y
"This watch looked like a fun watch so I bought it for myself. I'm in my 40s and I wear it often. I'm very pleased with it. Links are easy to link to create your own pattern. They stay in place with no slippage; I have no fear the band will fall apart. I have an average-sized wrist for a woman and had several links left over. The clasp takes some getting used to. It doesn't look like the watch will stay securely on your wrist, but I've had no trouble with it. I especially like the contrast of the bright yellow hands against the black face...or shall I say my ""older eyes"" appreciate it! I get a lot of compliments on this watch and I highly recommend it for casual wear.",Fun adult watch with easy-to-read dial,B000JNS97Y
as a 21 year old i probably have the coolest watch in zee wurl. i love it and think everyone should have one. bam.,Lego_licious,B000JNS97Y
"I thought it'd be a bit sturdier, being from lego and all. The plastic pieces of the strap quickly softened with use up and now come easily apart, which is good if you want it to be easy to change back and forth but bad if you're thinking of a resilient watch.  Still, for a kid it's awesome, has taken some good hits and it's still there.","It's ""OK""",B000JNS97Y
"Ok, you can buy a $5000 watch to impress superficials who recognize power names.  I did that although ""those watches"" cost $400 just to service and clean every couple of years and I now feel idiotic to have done that.  This watch is just plain fun and probably keeps equally accurate time.  You don't want to climb Everest with this like Rolex touts.  But I feel very practical and even Avant Gard wearing this.  Every time I wear it someone asks about it and smiles.  For about the price of a large Pizza and a lot longer lasting, you can't go wrong.  Oh yeah, kids seem to like them to.",Too fun,B000JNS97Y

It's fun to wear, and you can easily change the colors of the band to suit your mood, or your suit!  The face is large, but isn't too big for my small wrist.

Also, the Classroom brand pull up shorts are fabulous as well.",Great!,B000JQGCT8
"Helpful for children in uniforms that are either not so great at their buttoning and zippering or that are aggravated by a stiff waistband.  Decent quality for the price and this is a reasonably priced product.  Blends in very nicely with what the uniform company in our area sells.

"I've been wearing a Lego watch since a friend found one for me in a retail store in Germany a couple of decades ago. If I'm out in public, particularly doing air travel, I always get comments, and people are often surprised that there is such a thing as a lego watch. It certainly catches people's attention (especially flight attendants). I tend to forget it's on, since it's so light weight. Except on extreme days, I don't find my wrist full of perspiration. The negative of just owning one of them is that for the adult wrist, one needs about 24 links, and if you want a balanced number of repeating colors, it's short a green link. I like the larger size face, but the second hand is more prone to fall off. And that's the only problem with the smaller model -- that if dropped repeatedly the second hand will fall off on this one too, and then it jams. But for the price, I just order another one.",Best Watchg Ever,B000KFB4PK

"The style of the 505 jeans is GREAT!  I'm so happy to see them back in production ( I haven't been able to find them for years because they stopped making them).  They have a great fit in the thighs, seat, and hips...they're perfect!  (These are great if your man/son is thin through the legs, seat, and hips!)  I had to give them only three stars because instead of being manufactured in the USA with heavy grade, long-lasting quality jean fabric like they were 10-12 years ago, they are now made of ultra thin, flimsy, light-weight, cheap jean fabric made in Cambodia?(the WORST OF ALL!) and Pakistan, which wasn't quite as bad.  The quality of the fabric was astonishing.  Why do American companies that are such a part of the American icon take a risk and send their great, quality products to other parts of the world where the quality is so poor?  Levis is risking their reputation with the quality of these jeans.  I kept them anyway because of the tremendous fit; but the quality is GREATLY LACKING that of a decade ago when they were made here!

"The instructions about how to size the strap were not included. While attempting to size the watch, one of the pieces chipped.  I did have extras and when I figured it out, was not that difficult.  I hope the 'catch' will last long.  My son was very happy and it is unique, the little soccer player and ball were a hit too.  I would recommend the watch for all soccer fans!",Lego soccer watch,B000PXUA5W
"My son loves this watch.  I got it for him for Christmas for his ""first watch"". I wanted him to have an analog watch first so he could learn to properly tell time. This was a great choice because it is easy to read and has that great lego look.  I worried that the watch might fall apart while wearing it but that does not happen, its very well put together.  The only complaint is that because it's plastic, he can't wear it for more than a few hours without taking it off and letting the skin breath undernieth.  The watch itself is accurate and reliable.  All in all a good choice.",Great for first watch,B000PXUA5W

"My 60 year-old mom bought a Lego watch a few months ago. I'd been eying them since I was about 8, and hers looked so cool, I decided to invest in one, too. The number of compliments I've received on this soccer watch, from other 19 year-old college students and adults alike, has been pretty incredible.

The fact of the matter is everyone loves Legos, and having a watch that can be disassembled, reassembled, resized, and customized any way you like makes it even better.

Get one. The only thing the watch does is tell time, but it's very durable and classy.

UPDATE: It didn't last as long as I'd hoped -- less than a year. Actually, it was only one piece that broke, but it was one of the halves of the clasp, and there weren't any replacement pieces in the box. Bummer!",This watch rocks for all ages!,B000PXUA5W
Our son loves the soccer design. It is very functional. Many kids watches have a good design but are hard to read. Not this one! And it is surprisingly sturdy and easy to adjust! AAA+,Just great,B000PXUA5W
My son wears his watch everyday even to bed he loves it so much. He is 8 years old & he is able to put it on & take it off when ever he wants with out help.

"This suit was promising in the beginning.  Seemed to provide good sun protection (no tanning underneath) and had good coverage.  And, it wasn't too heavy.  My daugther didn't seem to mind wearing it in the 95 degree summer days.  However, it proved to be a big disappointment in the end.  I bought a size larger than I needed for my daughter, hoping it would last two seasons since it was pretty expensive for a swimsuit.  Unfortunately, it didn't even last through one.  The material thinned out significantly over the summer leading to a failure in adequate sun protection, as evidenced by the fact that my daughter started tanning in areas covered by the suit.  There were many areas were the material became so thin and worn out, my daughter would have had better protection wearing a nylon stocking.  Also, the suit ripped down one side despite no contact with anything sharp or shear force.  I have had better quality suits for less price in the past.  Although it was good while it lasted, it should at least last one season. I will not by this brand again.",Happy with the suit initially but quality quickly faded,B000ROO9BK

It has taken the inevitable falls from his bicycle, football hits, frisbee hits, baseball hits, casual tossing around that boys do...well you get the idea. I believe the money saved from action hero licensing has gone into making a better watch. My son likes the adult style and having a watch more like his dad has (the real action hero here).. He also really likes the velcro band. I found that rolling the leather tip of the watch band to match the curve of the wrist helps the end of the watch(which sticks out from the wrist on smallish wrists) to stick to the velcro near the watch case and thus from catching on things - looks better too.  At this price battery replacement is not necessary, unless they stop making this style. This watch has restored my trust in Timex, for the time being...",Adult-style kids watch,B000SZPZV6

"I bought several of these Indera Youth Union Suits for my 9 year-old son, and we have been very disappointed.  There are several issues:  1. They run super-small in the body.  He normally wears size 10-12, but neither the 10-12 or the 14-16 in this product fit him properly in the body, and both sizes give him a major wedgie.  2. The stitching is very flimsy and has not survived one gentle wash in cold water.  There are now threads hanging loose everywhere, and the arm seams have separated already, leaving a gaping hole under one arm.  All this without even being worn yet, mind you.  3.  The material is very lightweight, and while that may provide comfort and breathability, it doesn't seem like it is going to survive more than a few washings, and it certainly will not survive any boyish pre-bed gymnastics.  Let me put it this way:  Without even being worn yet, these suits already look as flimsy as my son's Costco pajamas look after a full year of washing, wear and tear, and they cost more.

I'm going to try and return these suits, and I hope you won't waste your time buying them.",Shoddy product,B000XRG27K

These socks are sized in inches, the numbers will be about the length of the child's feet.

Size 5-6 socks = Size 3 to 7-1/2 shoes = 1 to 2 years

Size 6-7 socks = Size 6 to 11-1/2 shoes = 1-1/2 to 4 years

Size 7-8 socks = Size 9 to 1-1/2 shoes = 3 to 7 years

"I recently purchased this watch and received it in the mail the other day.  This watch is beauitful and I have received numerous compliments on it.  If you are looking for a watch that feels high quality,  then you're looking at the right brand.  The individual wearing this watch is someone who is distinguishing themselves from the two main groups of watch wearers: 1. The trendy, huge-clunky, 43+mm watch wearers who think bigger/flashy/more buttons is better, and 2. The followers who are uninformed of what timeless and classiness is.  This style of watch (33-37/38mm, yellow gold,  white dial, Roman numerals and 4-6mm thickness, with black or burgundy crocodile band) is what politicians, bankers, ivy-leaguers, presidents, judges, and other elite, wear.  You will never see these types of professionals wearing massive clunky watches that are so trendy, ""hip,"" and worst of all, fashionable temporary. These types of people understand the concept of timeless and classy style and fashion.

This watch will surely catch the eye and impress the father who's hand you are shaking for the first time at your girlfriend's home.  It will impress both the job interviewer and the grad-school admissions interviewer. Lastly, if giving a toast at a party or formal gathering, hold your glass up high with the wrist that this watch is on.  Do not show off the watch during this moment of toasting; let the watch show itself off.  Let the watch show its elegance. Let the watch show its attitude.

As the Longines slogan states:

""Elegance is an attitude""",Elegance Is An Attitude,B0000V9I7A
The watch is very good but I don't particularly like the strap. I want to change the strap asap.,Four Stars,B0000V9I7A
"I usually purchase Seiko watches which keep great time, look good and are very reliable.  I could not find a round men's dress Seiko watch that was of a moderate size.  This Longines watch was a perfect find.  It's moderate in size, I measure the case diameter (without the crown) at 33 mm. The watch is thin at 6 mm.  For wrist sizing information the total length of the watch and band is 23 cm. The gold plate is very high quality and I would describe it as a mid-gold tone in colour.  The gold coloured second hand is a nice design touch.  The band is high quality but lighter in weight, which is nice since the watch is also light in weight.  Since this is a high quality quartz watch, it keeps perfect time.  If one is looking for a similar watch with a stainless steel case and white face, have a look at the Longines L47094112.  I have both of these watches which are elegant and timeless in design.",Understated Elegance !,B0000V9I7A
"I bought this watch 5 years ago, and apart from replacing the battery twice, it has become one of my favourite timepieces. It is beautiful, easy to wear, light, and I have never stopped admiring its classic and clean lines. I have worn it to work, casual outings, and even to dancing socials. I absolutely love this watch.",Classic and enduring,B0000V9I7A

"I've had a number of expensive watches (over $1,000). I was attracted to the craftsmanship and precision mechanisms found in the self-winding style watch. The problem was that neither of these expensive watches kept decent time -- losing several minutes a month. My new Longines has a classic analog look, but is quartz technology. I just checked its accuracy after one month and it is within one second of the precise time. Finally I'll have confidence in my time piece.","At last, an accurate watch!",B0000V9I7A
"I bought this watch as a present for my wife - yes the men's model. She likes a little bit bigger watches and this one was the perfect choice.
I think this model might be a good choice for most women, since the women's model is really tiny...

This watch is extremely elegant and unbelievably thin (and light). Its case is plated with real gold and believe me: it looks like real gold, not like some gold colored painting. The clock face is so sharp, so perfectly printed and so clear that you think you can read it from 15 feet distance.

Conclusion:
This watch is really a fantastic product, it is elegant and stands for certain understatement (it's not fancy!). And even as a men's model it's perfect for the ladies in size.
Besides all the features of the watch it comes in a very (very, very) representative case! The perfect gift...",Wonderful classical watch,B0000V9I7A

They have the Velcro closure which is perfect for her age and are a nice neutral color.  I would strongly recommend these again.  If you have looked around there isn't a whole lot of choices for the 5 yr old and under category of hikers.

It is a little big, but pretty good for 12-18 month sizing (maybe just a little closer to the 18 month end, which works for layering). It does have a nice lining which makes it pretty warm, too. It doesn't breathe very well, so my daughter gets a little sweaty if she wears the hood, but is the nature of rain jackets I think.

I took mychances and ordered this slip, and it fit the bill!

The shipping was quick, and the skirt fit perfectly, and was just enough fluff to go under her costume. She did alot of dancing, sitting, standing andmoving on stage, and she never complained about stiffness or that it ""itched"". The slip was soft and comfortable, and durable. It is still in good condition, and we have used it to go under some of her other outfits. I am very pleased with this purchase!","Cute, great price!",B001817FNU

She jumped on this and started to ride....She is in awe of this Bike....She wipes it down after a ride....she talks about it all the time....and everyone in the town loves the color.
The bike is well made and sturdy. The handle bars and seat height are adjustable so this bike should last a while. I would have given it 5 stars but the tires do not seem to be as well made as the bike...And being white tires (although they look great when new) are starting to show all the dirt...which my daughter keeps trying to clean.
So to finalize....This is an excellent well made bike...the price can not be beat and any little girl would be proud to own it..and any parent should be proud to give it.",Nice Bike...Excellent Deal,B000ZJWT2I

"My 3.5 yr old put these on at the start of a 10 day trip to Colorado for a lot of hiking.  They have held up well and were a perfect fit.  She currently wears a 10.5 -11.5 wide depending on brand.  These have very good tracking and she did at least 3 or more miles on both rocky, and mountain terrain with no problems.  They have the Velcro closure which is perfect for her age and are a nice neutral color.  I would strongly recommend these again.  If you have looked around there isn't a whole lot of choices for the 5 yr old and under category of hikers.  Keens are great but always run smaller and narrow; north face also makes some good hiking shoes and boots; merrells have always been a good crossover shoe for outdoor treks, walking, and casual.",They have held up well and were a perfect fit.

Gave this to my 1st grandchild Gracie for her 1st birthday in January.  We tried it on her but it has been too cold where we live to use it yet. It is so adorable on her and well made with sweet little wings and other accents. Well worth the investment.,Adorable raincoat!,B0015BSR94

"I was very happy to find a raincoat in my daughter's size, and such a cute one too. The price was not bad and the coat is very high quality so well worth the money. Both my kids think it is just hillarious that the coat has wings. My daughter will even want to wear it around the house. It is a little big, but pretty good for 12-18 month sizing (maybe just a little closer to the 18 month end, which works for layering). It does have a nice lining which makes it pretty warm, too. It doesn't breathe very well, so my daughter gets a little sweaty if she wears the hood, but is the nature of rain jackets I think. It seems to be very good quality and I love how much attention to detail they put into this jacket. I would definitely reccomend this to others.",good quality rain coat,B0015BSR94
"Ok, I would never spend this much on a rain jacket but it was a gift to y daughter from family.  I was a little upset at first because I was hoping for a matching ladybug jacket since she has ladybug boots, but this jacket is even cuter than her boots!  It's a 4T which is a little big for her (she's a 3T now) but she loves wearing it, even inside.  I love the bell cuffs and how it flairs out at the bottom.  the little wings on the back tops off the cuteness factor .

I got this watch about 10 years ago from a jeweler that would hook me up with custum items. His brother would design and fabricate jewelry. Anyway they had a couple of these watches on display and they had just hooked me up with a chain and custum made charm and I bought this watch to match. I got to say is been one of the greatest purchases I have ever made. I still wear the watch once and a while but I will be passing it on to my newborn son when he is of age. This watch and the chain  are both official. I've gotten so many compliments on this watch. I recommend it.,Pimped out watch,B0001WDD7E
"I got this watch when I was 15 years old, in 1976. Although, sending it out for maintenance is not cheap (about every 10 years, in my case) I really love this watch. I have worn it almost daily since I got it. I graduated high school, went to college, got married, joined the US Army (I even wore it while in Basic Training), deployed to Desert Shield/Storm, retired from the Army, etc. while wearing this watch and it still looks brand new. My childhood friends don't believe I still own and wear this watch.

The craftsmanship and mechanical quality is up to par with any top of the line Swiss watch out there. I get compliments on this watch almost daily. Buy it, you will not be disappointed. This watch will go to the grave with me, no doubt.",The perfect watch.,B0001WDD7E

"I bought a pair of these and I like the sole that is thinner than most other boots, but they have a wedge of rubber glued into the underneath of the sole.

I was tired of the plastic material that the new Nike & Adidas shoes were coming out with. I also wasn't feeling the neon colors either. In my youth I wore the Adidas Copa Mundials and they lasted the beating back then, so this time I went with Kaiser 5 and their just as perfect, amazing quality, the leather and the unique class that these boots yell out, the best buy in a long time.

"I must have looked at a dozen or more Lego watches.  I would have sworn they were rubber.  This one is not; it's plastic.  It's been dropped a few times and has survived thus far.  My 4 year old goes through phases of wearing it so it's not a 24/7 thing for him.  What's nice is you can take each piece (color) apart and arrange it in whatever order you want, other than the two black pieces that make up the clasp.  I like that it isn't character specific, like Star Wars, Toy Story or Cars, nor is it outrageous colors that will never go with anything.  I think you can also mix and match with pieces from other Lego watches (as long as they aren't rubber) so if you have a broken one or want a different face, it's nice to be able to mix it up. Also, I like the analog face so that my son can learn to tell time the REAL way and not just digitally. I only gave it 4 stars because the plastic is hard and he sweats under it.  I think that's the main reason my son won't wear it.  For the price, though, it's a great watch, especially for little ones learning to tell time.",Not what I thought . . .,B001M9JDGU
We ordered this watch for our 10 year old avid lego fan.  He was thrilled.  Found the watch to be a little on the small side (face only).

"I owned another LEGO watch in the same kids' size for over 10 years. After a half-dozen battery changes, it still kept perfect time ... until its trip through the clothes washer. I chose the City watch to replace it, so that I could have a wider variety of links for the band (they're the same size and shape of the links on my original watch). This new one keeps time just as well, and the watch gets just as many compliments.

If you're an adult female, I recommend the kids' size watch. I tried out the adult size, but it's more of a man's size -- it looked huge on my little she-wrist. This one is the perfect size. And the perfect price -- what other $25 watch will last 10 years? If it gets dirty, just take the links apart and scrub them with soapy water and an old toothbrush. Easy!","Kids, schmids.

"My husband has worn these shoes for decades.  He was disappointed, to say the least, when he found that the manufacturer had changed, and so had the shoe fit/size, construction, and some aspects of the style.  He had already removed the insoles and put orthopedic insoles in (as he has again, been doing for several years), having NO reason that the fit would have changed from the last several shoes of this exact size and style he has ordered and worn.  We therefore could not return them, and donated them to a local charity. We will not be ordering them again.","He was disappointed, to say the least",B0000ESTEA

I love these. They fit so well. Just perfect. I would recommend these to everyone. I never thought I'd wear thongs but I love them because there is no visible panty line. I don't like seeing that on anyone. Ugh!  Especially me. Not to worry with these. And they are comfortable too.,Great fit!,B000144RHC
"Let me make one thing clear at the outset: I. HATED. ALL. THONG. PANTIES.  With a passion.  Over the years, I experimented with all kinds of thong underwear, attempting to find one that didn't make me feel like I was walking around all day with a constant ""wedgie.""  I tried every type of thong in existence, from classic cut, to Brazilian, tanga, and G-string; in every type of fabric, e.g., cotton, tactel, satin, mesh, lace, and polyamide.  To no avail.

Enter Hanky Panky.  At first, I balked at paying $20 for a single panty, especially since I wouldn't be able to return it if it didn't fit or was uncomfortable.  But after striking out with some cheaper brands, and some not-so-cheap brands (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Gossamer-Women-s-Mesh-Hip-G-Thong-Panty/dp/B002AQSNX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Gossamer Women's Mesh Hip G Thong Panty</a>), I caved and purchased a couple pairs of these Hanky Panky thong panties in black, Plus-Size.  (I had to purchase them from a 3rd-party seller because Amazon doesn't offer the plus-sized Hanky Panky, which fits sizes 14-24).

These panties turned out to be the best $40 I ever spent!  For about an hour after I first put them on, I was on ""high alert,"" looking out for that familiar ""wedgie"" feeling to kick in, but it never did.  I ended up wearing these panties for the entire day (which included quite a bit of walking), and they were still as comfortable at 9 p.m. as they'd been at 9 a.m.  At heart, I'm still a bikini-hipster type of woman, but these Hanky Panky panties have come very close to making a thong convert out of me!  They will definitely be my go-to underwear of choice when I'm wearing certain types of clothes and need to avoid the dreaded VPL.  I adored them so much that I've already purchased a couple more pairs.

Hanky Panky definitely lives up to its catch-phrase: ""World's Most Comfortable Thong.""

Grade: A","FINALLY, COMFORTABLE THONG UNDERWEAR!",B000144RHC

"I am a fit specialist and very familiar with this bra.

Here's the inside scoop on this style 9955 Dream Tisha by Le Mystere. Since originally, the band fit so tight in this style. The company recently updated the fit of the band,, so what I mean is,,, the band on the newer version,,, now fits true to size. Ok,,, here's the catch,, some stores still have both,,, the original version (has black fabric label on inside band, which runs tight,, go up in band.)

Then the newer version that fits true to size in band,,,, (newer version has stamped on label on the inside band fabric,,, there is no fabric tag). So this is how you tell these apart,,, black fabric tag on band - go up in band,,,, stamped on label/info with no fabric tag at all - runs true to size. They made a slight variation in the fabric and cups,,, mainly just a bit softer feel and look overall. Hope this clarifies this issue.

Ladies, to get the best fit, be fitted by a fit specialist, especially when you are full fit. Please, don't get hung up on the size, but be very, very concerned about fit; correct fit is every thing. Most of us wear a different size in different style bras. No one and I mean no one, wears a 36D in all bras, never, ever buy a bra you have not tried on. You are wasting your money. It's just like buying a pair of shoes you have not tried on,,, all styles in bras and shoes fit different. Get the best bra you can possibly afford that really fits you well, lifts and supports.

Nothing should be popping out over the top of the cup, if it is go up in cup. Band should be snug to give full lift, but not cutting into you. With bra on, raise your arms straight up. Watch front of band in mirror, if it moves up much, band is too big, if bust falls out the bottom, cup is too small or could be both. Try this with all your bras at home. Get rid of the bras that don't fit, because gravity is now taking over all day long in the wrong fitting bra. That means, your breast tissue is stretching out,,, all day long, when you wear a bra that does not properly support the bust. Why do this to your self,,,, when you don't have to.

A correct fitting bra should hook on the loosest setting (first hooks), so when it stretches you can go tighter. Never purchase a new bra you must hook on the tightest setting. There is no where to go when it stretches. So, this will not lift you any more and your are wasting your money.

Clothing is designed to fit at the natural bustline, halfway between your elbow and shoulder. If your bust is not there, you don't know if your clothing fits properly.

Listen up on this, full fit ladies. If you wear the same couple of bras all the time. Your body oils break down the fibers in the bras, then they are worn out in a few months. But you are still wearing these a year later and sagging down to your elbow. No one should look like that. No part of the bust, should be lying on the stomach.

Purchase 4 - 6 quality bras that really lift and support you at the natural bustline. Let these air out a day or two before you wear the same bra again. Rotate wearing these bras. This gives you a bra wardrobe that all equally support you. Now you throw the bad bras,, that don't support in the trash,, because I don't want you to ever where these again.

I fitted my niece in this bra, she wears a 44F. She sweats easily, so I thought it might be too hot for her. But here's what she said, it's great because it lifts the bust up off the belly, so she does not sweat under there any more. Plus, she said her posture was much better and I could tell this too. She was probably lifted at least 3"" to 4"".

Also, think about this ladies, once you get the bust lifted to the natural bustline. You have more torso, giving you a taller, longer leaner look. Ok now, there are no more excuses for not having a great fitting bra. Believe me your back will thank you.

Here's some questions you should consider:
What allows your clothing to fit correctly?
What takes pressure off your back and shoulders?
What gives you better posture?
What makes a dart on blouse/dress fit in the right place?
What elongates the torso, making you look taller, slimmer, trimmer?
What should you wear when you go shopping for new clothing?

ANSWER: To all of the above,,, a well fitting, supportive bra.",How to get correct fit!,B00009UW4R

"I bought this for my 5 year old to learn to tell time, and she likes the light-up feature. But she rarely wears it because the strap is nearly impossible for her to adjust herself, and not easy for her parents either. I think this needs a velcro strap instead. The strap does expand to put over her hand, but they it's loose and needs adjusting.",Poor strap,B00284C9NW
"Our 16 month old grandson loves grandpa's indigo Timex watch.  He loves to see it light up in the dark.  So we got him the Froggie Indigo watch for kids by Timex.

And it's a Timex!",Tick-Tock! Tick-Tock!,B00284C9NW
"I ordered this for my 5 year old son.  It came exactly as pictured.  The stretchy band allows him to easily take it on and off himself.  The color, appearance and quality are good.  I would reccomend this for boys ages 3 - 6.  The color coded arms and #'s allow for teaching him how to tell time.  So far he has only worn is 5 times, and we've only had it a few weeks, so I can't attenst to how well the stretchy band will last...but it appears good.",Perfect!,B00284C9NM

"Wow, I totally disagree with the reviewer who gave it 3 stars, said not to buy, and said you could probably find a better watch at the dollar store. I was very pleased to get such a great watch for under twenty dollars. My 5 year old loves it. It's made well, looks nice, feels comfortable for my son, and it's helping him to tell time. I really like that it has a second hand. I also like that it is water resistant. Oh, and it has Indiglo! My son thinks this watch is awesome and so do I. If anything ever happens to it I wouldn't hesitate to buy him another one, esp since the price is right.",Excellent kid's watch!,B00284C9NM

"i'm 55 w/ a very small wrist, i usually buy timex kids watches.
i've had this watch for 3 years and am extremely active & almost never take it off.
in and out of water no problem.
the minor flaw is the black face w/the orange design; when you press the knob at night
to read, the design blocks the ability to see the watch hands. (maybe that's due to 55 year old eyes)

"I bought this watch for my son for Christmas and he loved it.  But, after 4 months, it began to get water into it.  He did not swim with it on, he just took a bath with it on.  A kids watch should be able to resist 12"" of water.","Nice looking kids watch, but it is NOT water resistant",B002CVTOU2
"I ordered this for my 8 year old grandson.  I was worried that it might be a little too big but it's perfect.  He was so excited to have his own watch.  The band is nice, the velcro closer is probably the only good option for this age.  I like that the watch is waterproof too.

"I have always bought timex kid watches and been happy.  This one we have had for about 2 months and the face or plastic crystal falls off,  Miraculously found it and tried to snap it back on, fell off again, so tried a few dots of super glue which fumed up and marred the plastic so it can't be read.

"I originally bought this watch as a gift for my 9-year-old son.  He liked it a lot and it held up well to daily use.  The velcro band did give out in a little under two years, though.  Shopping for a replacement, I wanted to find a new design, but the alternatives were all too cartoonish or overly bulky.  It was frankly easier to order the same watch again at this price than it was to find a compatible replacement band. Maybe he's easily satisfied, but my son is still pleased with this watch as an 11-year-old.",Worth buying twice,B002CVTOU2

"A watch isn't all that useful if it won't stay on.  The velcro used in the band basically fell apart in less than a month, so it won't stay closed and now the watch is pretty much unusable.  Total waste of money.

As a secondary issue, the way the front piece is cut out, the Hot Wheels car image cuts off the numbers, so it's kind of ridiculous to try and teach kids to tell time on it.

Definitely a disappointing purchase.","Velcro ""died"" in less than a month",B002MAR12Q

While it is picture perfect aesthetically, it is way too big for a child.  It fit me. We were able to resize it, with quite a bit of fine detail effort, and she can now wear it.  Having to completely rebuild a watch so my child could actually enjoy  isn't what we intended to do.","Cute, yet not an appropriate size for a child!",B002UUUNLO

I thought this watch would be perfect as it is cute and then as she gets older she could actually use to to learn how to tell time.  It shipped out quickly and arrived exactly as described.  The problem was that it broke less than 6 hours after we put it on her, we know because the watch stopped when the second hand just fell out rendering the whole thing useless.  So I read the directions on the Warranty and there is a 1 year warranty if I sent the watch and 5 bucks into the company.

"I have been informed this watch is The Best.

My son used his birthday and holiday gift certificates (thank you grandparents!) and he chose two Lego sets and this watch.  As much as he loves the Legos, he is absolutely thrilled with the watch and mini-figure Luke.  Even the little details are great (The Luke figure has a flesh hand and a gloved/mechanical hand for example).

We did have to help him a little with the set up--adjusting the pieces of the watch band and setting the initial time, which was no problem.  This is a GREAT item!

"I purchased this watch from Walmart for about 15 dollars after seeing it on this website. I bought it for myself, (Even though I am a 17 year old girl. I love Darth Maul and I needed a watch. How perfect.) I love putting it together and taking it apart. The plastic is really strong, but there is a downside to that; The pieces are kind of hard to take apart when it's just two pieces linked together - It takes some strength to pull them apart.

Other than that, Everything is perfect. Everything fits, everything works, infact, I am so impressed by how accurate the clock is. I set it to the correct time once, and the watch isn't fast or slow, it's perfect.

If you love Star Wars and need a watch, Don't be afraid to buy this. It's amazing quality and it's fun! Oh, and did I mention I got the cutest little Darth Maul figure with it?",Love this!,B00385WZC0
"I thought this would be a good gift for a little boy, but I was disappointed. The idea of assembling a LEGO watch is interesting. It involves children's participation, but the material is very cheap looking plastic, and seems easily breakable. And one of the parts, a ring for the watch face, doesn't fit in at all. Boys between 4 and 7 may be interested in this kind of stuff. According to the quality, I think it is worth at most $10, even though the list regular price is over $20.

"This watch was a birthday gift for my 6-year old boy.  He's had it for a little over one month now.  It comes with a Lego Mini-figure & he totally loves the watch & the figure.  It is very light-weight & the links come apart pretty easily (after you figure out they have to be in a certain position to release.)  In fact, they'll come apart sometimes when my son takes off the watch...which is the only downside.  The clasp is very easy to use.  Although, it is more of a 'hook,' but nevertheless, serves its purpose rather well.  The links come in 3 different colors & has 2 different snap-on 'face guards' so you can customize it anyway you'd like.  The watch face is a bit small but is still readable.  It also keeps time pretty accurately.  If your child doesn't like this character style watch, there are many others to choose from...and the price was 'just right.'  Overall, a good first watch for the price...especially with the Lego's brand name attached to it.",May This Watch Be With You,B00385WZC0

"I gave it to him for Christmas. He loves it. Every time I see him he's wearing his watch. He doesn't know how to tell time yet but I bet it won't be long. He does ""guess"" at the time. He will look at his watch and say ""Hey! It's 12 til 7!"" And then a little later, ""Hey, it's 10 after 2!"" He plays with the lego figure separately. I believe it ended up in his lego bin. But he likes to attach these little lego pieces to his watch as part of his play. On the band on either side of the watch face there is a lego piece as you can see in the picture. He ""customizes"" his watch with little legos on them. It was a great lego gift that was different from the rest he can wear all the time.",My 6 year old nephew loved it,B00385WZC0
My 7 year old grandson was thrilled with this watch. I was thrilled to give him something that he has enjoyed so much over the last few weeks.  It seems to be holding up well and he'll probably lose it before it stops working so I have no long range expectations!,Great present,B00385WZC0
"My children love Legos.  As in, they'll disappear for a few hours to build and then play with their creations in the Lego room.  So when my 5-year old was regularly telling time to the nearest 5-minute mark, we got him a Star Wars' themed Lego watch for Easter.  The links are very easy to add as the child grows, which is good with their still-rapid growth in early elementary years.  About a year later, the band's attachment to the watch face had worn enough that it was regularly disengaging; eventually, the watch fell off without my son noticing and was lost forever.  But he loved it so much and the timepiece is inexpensive enough, we decided to go ahead and replace it with yet another Star Wars' Lego timepiece, just with the Darth Maul character in place of the original Luke Skywalker.

If you want a watch that will last forever, you might consider something with a more traditional band.  But if you want something with engaging characters that children love to wear and use to practice their newfound time-telling skills, go with this piece.",Excellent choice for child's first time-piece,B00385WZC0

The watch's clasp is made of flimpsy plastic and can only be opened when in a 90 degree position.  It hasn't broken off yet but I don't think it will last more than a few days.

This watch make a lovely gift for a boy approaching puberty who is a Star Wars fan! Everyone loves Darth Vader.

"The nice feature is that you can adjust the size of the band easily.  The nifty lego figure is a big hit!  The only thing is that it's very light weight, which may cause it not to remain closed.",Cute,B00385WZ3O
"I bought it thid past Christmas for an 8 year old boy. He loves it. His mom says she does not let him wear it every day because he plays with it too much but, he still has it and in tact.

That is my only piece of advice, know who you're buying it for. This child is fairly mild mannered and takes care of his things but, the curiosity of taking it apart will have him w/missing links.

My son on the other hand is careless and rough, so he is already missing the links from his...but the watch face itself is still in tact.

It is also nice for them when they're learning to tell time. The numbers are visible, minute markers, and has the quarter minutes. Over all, I like the watch. I didn't quite think Happy Meal when I saw it but it is toyish, it's legos.",nice,B00385WZ3O
"Great watches for kids that love Legos and Star Wars.  My kids are just learning to tell time, and these are not the best watches for that (Timex makes some that are more helpful for learning to tell time), but they are great fun.  They like that they can interchange the guard around the dial and take the band apart to rearrange the color pattern (but of course there is an obvious downside to that).  The Lego figures that come with the watch are practically worth the price by themselves.  I actually wore this one once.  They are very lightweight and comfortable, and come with plenty of links for extending the size.  Great gift for Lego Star Wars lovers!",Great Gift!,B00385WZ3O
"This watch has the quality of something you would expect to get out of a Happy Meal or cereal box. Definitely not worth the money at all.

"My boys really loved these when they opened them on Christmas morning.  We sized them (no trouble at all, easy).  But when it came time for each of them to put their watches on, they had an incredibly hard time managing by themselves.  One son is 9, the other is 6.  Once they were one (with help), the watches snapped themselves off pretty quickly.  The clasp piece isn't as secure as I would like, and it came undone when they hit their wrists while playing.  One even came undone as my son tried to put his arm into his coat sleeve.  I love them because they are so cool, but it's not something they can use every day.","Very cute, but hard for a child to put on and take off",B003GSP24W

"Unfortuately with plastic watch bands, you never know what you are going to get. Given this was supposed to be LEGO, I thought the wristband material would be fairly substantial and durable. Not so. The parts the child is supposed to assemble and the catch are made of the flimsiest of plastic--brittle plastic--that can break or fall apart easily. Would not purchase again even if it was sold out in toy stores.",Cute idea not so nice in person,B003M2C41Q

"Loved the packaging and the concept of building a watch. But the assembly was too tough for me, and required some brute strength to fasten the links. Then I noticed that the second hand and the minute hand were moving at the same time when adjusting the time. Didn't think much of it when I realized that the second hand would go forward one second and then revert to original position. As a result it is not able to keep time and is basically useless. I live outside of the US so its too much of a pain to have it returned. Learnt my lesson though...Stick to watch brands that you know!",Difficult to assemble and did not work either,B003M2C41Q

"Buyer Beware! I bought this watch to replace the Timex my son loved and wore every single day until it broke and he is afraid to wear it because he thinks it will fall off and get lost. He loves Star Wars, as does any 8 yo boy, but his favorite part of this watch was the little Yoda action figure that came with it. As for the quality of the watch, the case is cheap plastic and while it says water resistant to 133 feet, I would be afraid to let him wash his hands! If I can find all the parts, I will return this watch and buy him a Yoda action figure... or ten. Don't waste your money!",Caveat Emptor!,B003M2G0SY
"I bought this and another character for my 8 year old son and another 8 year old boy. The watch is very nice, great concept. He is still grasping the concept of time so I love that it has the minute markers on it and the numbers are visible.

My son is a little rough and for some reason, every day he'd come home with half of the links in his hand. It got to the point where they didn't really stay on well. I blame this on my son more than anything.

So I wouldn't say this is a bad or poorly constructed watch as other reviewers have said, but I will say that you should know who you're buying it for. If you have one of those curious kids who take things apart, or one who is just rough and careless, then maybe it's not a good everyday watch for them. He still uses the face to tell the time, just lost all of the pieces becuase he's careless.

It's a nice watch.",Not that bad,B003M2G0SY

"There are several parts that make up the watch band, and that's in the spirit of legos. Take one out, and the watchband gets shorter, and we had to take out like 6 pcs. to get it to fit my 6-year-old. The clasp isn't too complicated, and my kid figured it out pretty quickly. There's also a round black piece that will replace the gray circle that covers that watch face... if you like black better... or if you should lose the gray one.

My 8 year old son got this watch for Christmas and was so excited.  He loves star wars the clone wars and loves Anakin so it was perfect.  Plus he really needed a watch.  But it's only been about a month and the part of the watch face that attaches to the band broke and now he can't wear it anymore.  I'm very disappointed and he is too.  I'll be replacing it but not with a lego watch unfortunately.  I can't risk it breaking again so soon.,Loved it... until it broke,B003M2BZPW
"Bought this watch for both my boys, ages 5 and 8. They had fun re-arranging the watch pieces, and it was neat that you can add/subtract links easily to make it fit.

"My son loves its adjustable and fun factor.  It helps him learn to read analog time.  He even builds his watch upward and outward with more lego pieces.  I am concerned this watch won't have a long life time.  The lego pieces of the watch sometimes snap open, and one day the watch will fall off or if we lose an important piece, it will not be usable as a watch.  However, I can imagine the individual pieces being recycled in a new lego creation!",Fun analog child's watch,B003M2BZPW
"Lego's and Star Wars have been around for a very long time with good reason.  Both are so well done that each new generation loves them.  This watch and several other Lego/StarWars items were on the top of my Grandsons wish list.

"My daughter really loves these watches, and I say that in plural.  We have now gone through 2 of them.  The first time was sort of her fault, she wore it in the shower for a minute, these watches are definitely not water resistant, and the water warped the inside face.  then the band broke in a separate incident.  So was she too hard on the watch?  The jury is still out on that one.  Then, as a surprise, because she really loved the watch, I bought her another one.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and she was just walking along at a store with me and it fell of, but we had all the parts.  It was the pin that goes between the watch and the band.  Overall I give the cuteness of the watch a 5 for girls that are pre-teen.  The quality is about a 2, it does keep time but is obviously cheaply made.  I give the band a 3, it breaks easily, it is rubber and looks cool and comfortable, so it does get an ok grading.  I think this is a watch you would be taking your chances on but you can usually get it for under $20.  With that being said, if you want quality you can find better quality for maybe double the price if you look for some other watches.","Cute cute, but band breaks",B004BYJXRC

"This is a cool watch. My son loves it. The colors are great. Lego pieces can attach to it. Easy to swap bands out.

Cons:
Too easy to swap bands. It keeps unclicking from the watch face causing it to get lost. My son isn't wearing his anymore.

My son is extremely small for his age. He had to use the bigger band. so If your child is older than 5, this may be too small. My son is the size of an avg. 4yr old and really skinny.

IMO it came with too many pieces. There's 2 bands, 2 extra snap on rings for the watch face and the alien. I think it had bricks, too.",looks great!,B004LLK6MQ

So comfortable I don't have a problem wearing them all day, and love that the straps never, ever slip down.  The front closure is nice too.

"I completely agree with the other reviewers.

This is the best fitting bra I've ever brought and it's worth every dollar.

I love Wacoal bras in general.  They really are the best made in the WORLD.  But a note to those top-heavy, full-figured gals, try another style.  I've tried other style bras in my size and it made me feel like a little girl playing dress-up.

I love this style#65115 because I am a B cup and if you are a B cup, this will fit you to a T.  If you want to try a front closure T-back Bra, try style# 65124.

If you want it to last for years and years, wash in the gentle cycle and ""hang-dry"".  There is no reason to put it in the dryer unless you want it to wear out sooner.  Mine are many years old & they look brand new.

Over 20 years ago, I remember being in the bra section of a dept store and I was almost in tears because none of the underwire bras I tried felt comfortable.  I was told that they lifted you up better than the wireless bras I was wearing.  A clerk walked by and asked me if I was doing ok, I told her about my frustrations and asked her what brand she wore and that is how I discovered Wacoal.  I never looked back.
Save yourself the frustration and just try it on.

That's all it will take for you to become a loyal buyer.",Remember Wacoal style#  65115,B0000ZFDT8

"I love this Bra! It is a repeat sale. I have it in black as well and am going to buy a white one as well. It fits great on the sides,its light and as I love the color.  its hard to find an unlined and supportive bra that is pretty too! Wacol you (we) got a winner! Ty",Pretty yet supportive!,B0000ZFDT8
"I've worn this particular model for years, and although I generally hate underwires, this bra is amazingly comfortable for many hours of wear!  However, I take great care of undies that cost this much, and mine last a *long* time.  I have the same measurements now that I did years ago, and something has indeed changed with this particular model.  The bra band for a size 34D is several inches shorter now.  I would suggest that people used to one they bought a couple of years ago keep the same cup size but go up one band size or more.  If I were to try ordering this one online again (which probably won't happen), I would specify at least a 36D instead of my usual 34D",Sizing may have changed in the last several years.,B0000ZFDT8

"I love this shoe! I bought this shoe to take with me to Costa Rica for a month of exploration in the mountains.  The shoe fits snuggly and you don't need to worry about it falling off of your foot in the water.  This shoe drains quickly once it has been submersed in water.  It was nice to not have to wait for days for my shoes to dry out before I could use them again. It does take some time for the upper part of the shoe to dry out as it is cloth, but it's not a huge deal as they were dry the next morning.
I have really enjoyed the traction of this shoe as well. I was climbing on rocks that were wet and walking through water and then climbing on more rocks to get where I was going.  I had no problem getting traction, no matter how wet the bottom of the shoe was.
I really like that this shoe is so casual, it looks like a regular tennis shoe, but there's so much more to it! The added plus is that there is a great sole insert that provides great support for your body. I really liked being able to wear my hiking shoes with my shorts and not look like I was going hiking.
I highly recommend this shoe to anyone who does any type of hiking or boating.  I really enjoy the structure and stability this shoe has to offer.
If you are looking for a sizing guide for this shoe, you can go to [...] and find the shoe and then look at their sizing guide. They even have instructions for measuring to make sure you get a great fitting shoe.
You won't regret purchasing this shoe.",What a great shoe!!!!,B0002528IU
"My wife and I will be taking a vacation later this summer, so I bought matching pairs of Nevados V6474M Kariba sandals in the closest sizes available.  Mine were way too small, her's were way too big, and we both agreed the appearance left a lot to be desired.  We also felt the open sides would let a lot of sticks and rocks in. So, we returned the Nevados and ordered the Columbia Outpost Hybrids.

We ordered our usual shoe size (5-1/2 and 10-1/2) and both pairs of the Outpost Hybrids fit perfectly.  We were also much happier with the running shoe appearance, than the sandals that look like some kind of weird space boots. The Outposts look ""normal"" enough to wear to the store after hiking, and also have much better traction.

Last weekend we had the opportunity to go hiking with them at the local park.  I was a little concerned about wearing the shoes without socks, but we were both very pleased with how comfortable they were to wear barefoot. We found the Outpost Hybrids to have excellent traction, both on loose gravel paths and climbing up steep rock trails. Just for fun, we went wading when we got down to the lake, and were quite happy with the performance of these shoes. The rocks, sticks, and other debris stayed out, but they drained quickly once we were out of the water. Perhaps just as important, they were still very comfortable to walk on dry trails with after being dunked in the lake. No squishy sounds, no rubbing, and no pruney feet when we took them off.

They were slightly damp when we got home, but still very comfortable. We did pull out the removable insoles when we got home and it took overnight for them to dry completely, but we certainly wouldn't hesitate to wear them in their slightly damp condition.

Overall, these are some of the best shoes we've ever purchased. They should work great for our trip this summer where we'll be hiking in rivers and across dry land. Just what we were looking for.

The only negative, they have a fairly strong plastic smell. My wife says they smell like bandaids. I assume that will go away over time.",Great Hiking Shoes,B0002528IU

really forget that I have it on. My girdle experience is very positive - it is undetectable and I would not

"A lot of how this piece of shapewear is going to fit depends on your butt and the length of your torso.  I have a slightly shorter than average torso, but also a slightly larger than average butt.  So, in the front, the shapewear comes up to my bra, but in the back it hovers only a couple inches above my natural waist, meaning I have a bit of a bulge over the top of the shorts in the back.  If only it was a little bit longer in the torso back there!  Then I'd get the all over slimming effect I was hoping for.  As is, I don't have any muffin top on my thighs and my waist is nicely slimmed.  In addition, it's comfortable, relatively pretty, and has the added bonus of garter hooks for stockings (which I love!).  The slit crotch is also handy.  I find that the back-muffin is reduced if I correct my posture and don't slouch, but I'm not used to having perfect posture all the time, like I did when I was younger.  Ideally, this piece of shapewear would do exactly what I had hoped it would, but as is, it's still a pretty good pice of shapewear and I do recommend it.",Depends a bit on body type.,B000147990
"Pros:

 >Despite nice loose rubber lace edges to smooth out the lines, still leaves very noticeable indentation rings right in the middle of the thigh
 >Distributes tummy above the top resulting in a very noticeable spare tire tummy above the waist (looks extremely odd and noticeable)
 >Permanent metal garter clasps that can be painful

"I was very excited about getting this watch for my 6 yr old but was very dissapointed when I received it. The watch itself is cute and I love that the hour and minute hands are labeled. It also comes with a small paper practice clock. However, the thing that so sorely dissapoints me is the band. It is a strong Velcro band but very poorly designed. It really only sits or secures well at one size. And what's the point of an adjustable band that doesn't actually adjust? Not every child has the same size wrist. Technically I think you could adjust it but the band is so thick it is hard to get it to bend and I'm not sure it would ever flatten down. Plus, when you make the band bigger it leaves the scratchy part of the Velcro exposed. That would be irritating and annoying within minutes.
This watch is being returned. Luckily I found a very similar one (also by Disney) with a soft adjustable leather band that we love. Wish I had found it the first time around.",Dissapointing,B005OVF8SE

"I managed to grab this watch while it was a lightning deal, priced significantly lower than what appears to be the regular pricing.  My rating might be a half star lower at the regular price point.  The watch and wristband are both solid builds though the strap can be irritating over a long period of wear.  The numbers for both hours and minutes are both easily readable and the hands are contrasted nicely as well.

This is an attractive watch and my child liked telling time by Mickey's hand movements but the watch face cracks VERY easily.

"I was surprised that the face of the watch, which is glass, is higher than the bezel.  The first one we received was already chipped. We are waiting on the exchange.  If my nephew (2 1/2 ) wasn't smitten with it, I would return it instead do exchanging it. Glass gives clear view, but how practical is it really when the kids are going to break it eventually and get glass on then, or worse yet, in them.",Glass watch face is higher than bezel,B005PKZG5E
"I bought this watch to help my kindergartener tell time since they just started learning that in school.  Terrible watch for this purpose!  Face is too tiny, the hands are white so you can't see them against the face and the numbers (05, 10, 15) that I thought would help him are SO TINY you cannot see them at all.

This watch would probably be good for a smaller child but not for someone learning how to tell time.  Back it goes.",Not for older kids learning how to tell time,B005PKZG5E
I bought this watch for my 2 and a half year old son .  He loves watches and is very good with recognizing #'s already.  We previously bought him cheaper watches that all broke.  So far he loves this one because of Mickey Mouse and there's # on the watch itself as well as the bezel to learn the minute hand function.  The Velcro is perfect for taking it on and off and proper sizing.

I have had so much trouble buying shoes that fit my feet.

When I got these I slipped them on and it was like putting on your favorite old shoes.

Also, they are almost so mallible and thin that they are uncomfortable. The material is so soft you have to constantly make sure nothing scrapes or snags on it. I have to admit I was a little disappointed because the other styles I have purchased from Minnetonka have held up so much better, and these deer skin slip ons were significantly more expensive.

"Cyber-Warriors is divided into two tapes.  It is all centered on the US military's future high-tech projects and training programs, namely the US Army's.
Cyber-Warriors shows what each weapon and the training is meant to do.
The first tape called the ""Digital Battlefield"" covers future digital programs such as the M1A2, Apache Longbow, Commanche, Land Warrior, micro aerial vehicles, and remote-controlled robots.  While the narration only provides a general overview and brief information, the footage is excellent and exclusive.  You get to see the interior of the M1A2 and the M1A2 in action on the training field, getting dirty and firing its weapons.  The same applies to the other areas.  Perhaps the best footage in my opinion is Land Warrior.  I've seen many photos of the system but never any video until this tape.  Shown are the thermal images (TI) via the TI camera on the rifle and the actual ""windows"" displayed on the helmet eyepiece.
Fictional future scenarios are included, similar to a Tom Clancy book.  The scenarios generally show what weapons are used (tanks and helicopters moving and firing).  It's all very politically correct, citing that superior firepower, technology, and situational awareness will win the day.
The second tape highlights training for the digital war.  Covered are tank simulators and tank computer gaming and terrain-generating computer 3-D maps.  Virtual reality and unmanned aerial vehicles are discussed as are the future gadgets that will be carried by Army scouts.  Also covered are networks and ""black secrets"" such as chips with transmitters in them to secretly send messages.  It's all pretty technical and not discussed in-depth because of its secrecy but makes for some interesting viewing.  Unlike the first tape, the actual gadgets, hardware, and technology are not really studied at all, just shown to the viewer and described what it does.  This second tape is more about software than hardware.  It's interesting to see these games and the new software being developed.
The video footage is excellent and extraordinary and well worth seeing.  The viewer will learn of new programs and developments being created and studied in the US Army.",Excellent Footage About Warfare in the Future,6305121869

"Six Stars!! These are my husband's favorite-ever garment. These shorts fit well and look nice; they're spectacularly well-constructed and stand up to a beating. Bought this pair to replace his roughly 10-year-old Survivalists which he wears nearly every day during hot weather: he wears 'em for yard work, goes hiking & fishing, washes 'em frequently and they've lasted like good quality clothes are supposed to! They're equally good for hard work or for lazing around the house or going out for a casual meal. The only reason he finally needed a new pair is that after 9 or 10 seasons of hard use the fabric wore through in one place (one spot on the leg under the cargo pocket that wrinkles because of his body size & how he sits). These shorts are MADE TO LAST!

The fabric is heavy-duty, coated cotton that feels really soft from day one: this fabric has a wonderful 'hand' - ""it feels great to wear"" (direct quote from The Husband). Along with the quality elastic in the waist there is a sturdy-but-soft heavy-duty cotton drawstring, a feature my husband loves. Multiple pockets make these handsome shorts very good for things like fly fishing or any endeavor where you need to stash a few things for easy access, and the pockets are sturdy too with reinforced stitching in all the necessary places.

If you need a pair of shorts that will be comfortable, perform well, look good and put up with abuse these are the shorts for you. I sure wish they made 'em for women!",Soft & comfy & wear like iron: the perfect guy shorts!,9789892837

"This summary of Africa's music obviously has to include a huge variety of music from the continent, and it does. It's mostly because African music is not my favorite that the rating is not higher. There are styles to be expected, like Senegalian pop from Youssou N'Dour, Congolese soukous, (which on this album sunds sad rather than happy), and a great track from Nigeria, Abami, which is a fusion of ""Afro-pop, Afro-beat and Afro-jazz,"" and rolls along in an adictive way. But this album also includes a lot of side trips to other African styles you don't usually hear, including Arabic tracks from Morocco and Algeria; Arabesque from Aisha Kandisha's Jarring Effects, and Bellemou, who contributes a catchy song in the Algerian rai style. There's also great Latin-sounding Portuguese music from Cape Verde, a French-language song from Madagascar, and soulful South African reggae (Lucky Dube's Prisoner, with its powerful lyrics). There's also some traditional music, as well as a very westernized jazz track. There's a very beautiful song from Guinea, and a slow, sad song about Aids. Much of this album is really made for dancing. Some of the songs I like very much, and others I don't appreciate as much. Some of the proceeds go to helping Oxfam and its wonderful work worldwide, which is great.",Africa,B00005NBV6
"It's not bad. I'm new to African music, but I was hoping to find some stuff from Mali, Kenya, Ethiopia or Tanzania here - and there's nothing from there. There's a lot from southern Africa; two tracks from Mozambique, two from South Africa, and stuff from Madagascar, Zimbabwe and the Congo. Interesting tracks from Morocco (electronic Arabesque) and Algeria (Spanish inflected rai).

In general, though, there's a definite pop or modern sound to ALL of the music here. I was hoping to get more traditional African music in what's supposed to be an overview of African music. The unauthentic jazz track from Ibrahim Abdullah (South Africa) really irritated me, and the English language reggae track from Lucky Dube didn't really sound African. Tito Paris track from Cape Verde almost sounded like an excuse to slip Latin music into an African compilation. Though it sounds like cliche, I had hoped to get the feel of the elephants, Maasai, rhinos and national parks that is really Africa.

The enhanced portion of the CD was very enlightening, showing how Oxfam helps in Africa. Perhaps I'm being too harsh to a release whose sale goes to charity. But it was a short CD in length, and they could have replaced the jazz track with some music from Mali.

Some people will love this CD I'm sure, but I liked only half or more of it. Still, it's not too bad","not bad, but frustrating",B00005NBV6
"I bought this CD before hearing a note of it first.  I rarely do that but I have no regrets in this case. From Cristina Branco's opening plucky tune right through this CD is a masterful trip through Europe, leaving no corner of the continent unturned.  From the Baltic to the Balkans, Ireland to Russia this CD covers it all.  I would love to pick out some highlights to talk about specifically, but each tune is a gem.  Randomly I'll choose a few.  Dilele by Angelite/Fanfare Ciocarlia is an uptempo blend of folk music from two very different Balkan countries.  The blend of Romanian and Bulgarian styles is astoundingly beautiful. Eliza McCarthy's 10,000 miles is an uplifting contemporary folk song from Britain that'll make you hum along after the first couple listens.  Arapiko Louloudi by Eleftheria Arvanitaki will make you feel like you're sitting in a Mediterranian cafe sipping retzina.

"I wrote a review back in 2009 for a watch that was similar to this one, so I will just go ahead and post what I had written 6 years ago:
------------------
2009:

I've recently purchased my new Casio remote control watch from Amazon for a great price and an amazing deal, considering that this type of watch goes for $50+ at my local Walmart. My only gripe with this product is that, after about 2 years or so, the battery completely dies out. I've tried to replace the battery in the back of the watch twice, only to discover that, after putting everything back together again, the new battery does not work, even though it's the same exact brand and make of the battery that's included with the watch, even positioning the battery the correct way.

It's a great item to have if you like pulling pranks on your friends or changing the channel at your local restaurant, but be prepared to have to fully replace the watch every 2 years or so. I'm already on my third Casio remote watch within the past 5 years, but I absolutely love them. I would never consider getting another standard watch, even without the remote functions, as these watches are very durable and reliable during the 2 years of use I get out of them.
------------------
2015:

Seeing as how it's currently the year 2015, I do not believe the T.V. functions are incredibly useful anymore.  Obviously the VCR functions cannot do anything unless you happen to stumble across somebody who still lives in the '90s.  It was great to play pranks on friends and people in bars/restaurants, but, I cannot get it to work most of the time.  It is, however, still good for the date and time.

This watch fits my needs perfectly, the time display is large enough to easily read, and the crystal is flat.

I'll be sorry when it eventually bites the dust, from what I've seen the past few years Timex has gone to strange-looking  """"Ironman"""" style watches, with curved crystals and such.  I had two previous Timex Ironman watches before this one, the flaw on those were the knobs from the watch that jutted out to attach the band, if you hit the watch aginst something those knobs would break-off and that was it for the band.

1) Top display is too small in chrono mode. This is where your current split is displayed. Center display showing total time is fine, but top is not easily readable while running. Makes reading it a chore. Many other icons too small to read easily, like ""chrono running"" and ""chrono stopped"".
2) I'm not a fan of having the chrono STOP button right beside the start/split button on the face of the watch. In a race, it's too easy to hit the stop button and mess up everything. Keep the stop button far away on the side, like the original Datalink watch.
3) Date format in time mode is 'YY. MM-DD in that tiny top display. Who needs to see the year at all, much less first? Confusing. Is it August, or '08?
4) There's no ""Night Mode"" or Flix icon on the watch. My old Datalink had one! How do I know if Flix mode is on?
5) The Indiglo night light is fairly dim.
6) BIG ONE: The Flix mode self-cancels after a few hours, for mysterious reasons not explained in those microscopic superfolded instructions. I tried two different watches, same result. Maddening. Now I have to use my hand to turn on hands-free Flix mode. Not smart.
6) The Flix mode must triggered by a fairly violent punching maneuver, a strong SNAP perpendicular to the watch face. It takes a fair amount of effort, and you might hit yourself or someone next to you. You'd certainly wake up someone sleeping beside you. Eventually, you might throw out your elbow accelerating your entire wrist and forearm. Wouldn't a nice snappy wrist twist be more user friendly and less injurious?

The watch looks good, fits well, holds a lot of timing splits, and performs its timing functions properly. But in terms of ergonomics and user friendliness, Timex could have made better use of this watch's features. I give it a B-.",Useful but Flawed,B00006I5YG
i had the lighter shade version of this and it finally disintegrated after about 5 years of HEAVY usage (military mainly) would have very likely lasted longer if regular contact with oil wasn't put into the equation.,a very good watch,B00006I5YG
"I have been using this model watch for 10 years now.  I love it, and I just checked in to check that it is still available (I'm happy to see that it is).  It has all the features I want.  I am a runner and a scientist.  It keeps precise time, up to 100 lap times, two time zones, five alarms, etc..  If you turn off the lighting (which is still available when needed) the battery will last about five years.  The straps need to be replaced more often (every two-three years).  If anyone finds a better watch they should let me know!",Classic still working,B00006I5YG
The watch itself works fine and chimes out the intervals exactly as programmed but I found the instructions to be printed in type that so small that they were hard to read. Also the instructions would be easier to follow if they were set up in a flow chart type format.,Review of Timex Watch for Interval Timing,B00006I5YG

"I don't know how many pairs of this shoe I've owned over the years -- maybe around ten.  I've run thousands of miles in them, but they're my walking shoes too, and if you need to stand for hours at a time they're great for that too. They're one of the few running shoes that come in different widths, and they offer the kind of support, stability, and cushioning podiatrists recommend for flat feet.  I use prescription orthotics and wear them under the insoles.  I've tried the more expensive 2001's with leather in place of suede, but the 991's seem to last longer and hold up better. They're made so well they never fall apart, instead they just slowly lose the cushioning and support.

"This bra was by far my favorite: a pretty design, good fabric, well-fitting and  supportive. I was very disappointed to discover it's been discontinued. If there is any current Vanity Fair bra that looks, feels, and supports as well as this one, what is it?",Why Was This Great Bra Discontinued?,B00008IF5W
"I purchased this bra years ago locally and loved it.  It was soft, elegant looking and gave good support.  I'd purchased a number of them so I am down to the wire on what I have left to wear so I decided to look online for additional ones.  As luck would have it,the bras is discontinued but some online store had them in stock.  I ordered from several stores only to return the bra because the sizing and fabric had been changed.  What you see in the images is not what the bra looks like and definitely not how the bra feels. First, the bra does not stretch well.  Putting it on reminds me of the girdles that women wore in the 1970's.  I remember my mother pulling on this stiff un-giving object that stretch just enough to slide on.  This is how the bra feels.  I was sent the off-color white that was a flat color, not the soft sheen the original ones had.  I ordered a 34DD and in comparison to other 34DD, this cup was smaller.  The band around the bottom was tight, scratchy and uncomfortable.  I'd just been fitted by a professional who said I wore a 34D, but the DD was way too tight.  I guess bras are going the way of women's fashion. Less fabric & smaller cuts means higher price.  I would not recommend this bra unless your skin is tough as sandpaper.",Not the original design,B00008IF5W

"I tried my first Vanity Fair bra when I moved to a town next to a Vanity Fair factory.  A neighbor, who worked there, gave me one to try.  I was hooked.  That was in the early 1980's.  Since then, I have tried to be objective and have tried a couple of different brands.

But, I always come right back to my favorite bra Vanity Fair's My Satin Fantasy Underwire.  Being a ""full figured"" woman, it's hard to find a bra that supports effectively no matter how active I am.  It wears and washes well, and still looks silky, pretty and sexy.  This one has it.  I'm at the point in my life I don't even bother trying the newest fad.  This one is perfect.  Always has been, always will be.",There really is no better!!,B00008IF16
"I am so sad that this bra is so hard to find now.  I am a sturdy 36DD who is fairly active.  This one fits, moves, and can be worn all day with comfort.  It offers wonderful support and gives me a good sillouette. I have been wearing them for decades punctuated by other always inadequate bras when I can find this.  I am really hard to fit.  This bra lifts and separates without going way out to the side interfering with arm movements or cramming the girls together to make a shelf.  The unique crossing front gives freedom of motion, I can reach way up with one arm without having the whole bra shift and get out of wack.

I would prefer, no lines, and a front closure, but there have been no bras that work for me that are that way.  Since the fabric is cut on a bias and has no foam padded preformed cup the bra can shape itself to YOU. No unsightly bulges around the cup!",The only bra that fits and is comfortable,B00008IF16
"I used to love this bra.  I liked it so much that I sought out my bigger 40-42DDD size online once I had trouble finding it locally in stores.  But, due to a couple of design flaw that would be easy to fix, I've moved on to other bras (with their own shortcomings).

This bra has great no-stretch straps that really work to give lift.  But the straps aren't the padded style so they perform their lift but dig into your shoulders.  Ouch.  The straps are rather wide-set, too, so they're constantly sliding off your shoulders.  I had to go to my local sewing ""notions"" store to buy little straps you pin into your clothing that harness the straps in place so they won't migrate.

The other thing is that the criss-crossing between the cups is the first thing to go.  I wash my delicates in a special, wired bra bag but these crosses just don't hold up for long.  The constant sliding of those crosses against one another is like a saw and they break through eventually.

I wish the manufacturer would fix these things so I could go back to this bra.  I like how the crosses are more likely to lie flat against your breastbone which gives you good separation.  I buy bras now that squeeze everything together but it's preferable to broken crosses and falling-off shoulder straps.  Too bad.",A Good Fitting Bra But it Still Needs a Few Improvements,B00008IF16
"I've been trying to find a decent bra for ages: one that would be attractive *and* hold things in place at the same time. I was afraid I'd be doomed to the old 1950s bulletproof, cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever...and those are anything but seductive.(I recently changed bra sizes from one that stores carried in multiple styles/selections to a 34DDD, which you have to order online or have made- at astronomical prices.) I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy. Even though this bra is a sedate white, it still passed the husband whistle-test. :) Not bad!","Great bra--Sexy, but still holds as well as grandma's bulletproof ones!",B00008IF16

For about a 1-1/2 years I bought more and more of this style bra - I had them in all 3-colors.  Then one day I was in the store and horror - no more of my favorite bras!  I looked and I looked and it took me about 3-years but I found that Bare Essentials carries my bra!  I was in haven - I quickly rushed for my AMEX card and ordered 3 - one in each color.

The strappy bit that wraps around the toes is too thick, too, to effectively be worn with a reasonable variety of sandals.  I bought them to try with my wedding shoes, but they clearly won't work on any level.  Will try Hue first, then DKNY.  Hoping that something affordable works out ASAP.",Ouch!,B00008IPE0

If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.

It is extremely tacky to wear stockings with sandles, and with  airconditioning in buildings, I need stocking to keep me comfortable.  Quite often I remove my stockings when I go outside to the hot day!

Recommended to anyone that wants shape without adding size, though if one is on the smaller side, since it would give good support, it would make one look larger than with an average bra.

"Pros-

1. Good Price my current home town store sells these for 109.50
2. The shoe just looks awesome.
3. Great slip resistance.

Cons-

1. Not comfortable at all after the first 3 hours of wearing the shoe.
2. The plastic on the end of the shoe strings is cheaply made and could be easily frayed if not taken care of properly.

Overall- I rate this shoe as fair in my opinion, I would not recommend this shoe for all day wear.",Nice Shoe but not so much comfort.,B0000A522B

Horrible quality.  Took them out of the box and could actually see the glue marks and glue strands as if the shoes were just put together with a hot glue gun!

I've used Prince shoes for awhile.  Prince shoes last the longest for me.  I play tennis only once or twice a week and usually use one pair for a year or so.  Love the fit for my wide feet.  This shoe is light but still sturdy.  I've also used this shoe for my zumba workouts and so far its been great.  I like the color--neutral--won't clash with anything I'm wearing ;-).,Great tennis and zumba shoe,B0000ACXIV
"This shoe is a great court shoe for someone who needs alot of support esp. for a high arch.

They run big so take that into consideration when purchasing these court shoes.",Great court shoe!,B0000ACXIV

"Spongebob Squarepants:BFBB is one of the few licensed games on the GBA that is actually decent. However,there are a few problems weighing down from the greatness it could have been. The story is that Plankton created a robot duplication machine and tries to take over Bikini Bottom,the keyword being 'tries' because he accidentally sets it to disobey (don't ask),the robots are rampant,and our favorite little sponge has to save Bikini Bottom. It may sound cliched,but considering Spongebob's horrible plots as of now,it is pretty good. The gameplay is a typical 2d platformer,you play as Spongebob,as you go through 4 parts of Bikini Bottom fending off the 4 main robot replicas of Sandy,Patrick,Squidward,and Spongebob. During the journey,you will meet up with familiar characters,like Patrick,Mr. Krabs,and one-time char.,Mystery,who is playable in certain sections in the game. The seahorse can eat through certain obstacles,consume enemies,and spit out enemies on switches. While this may sound cool,the controls on Mystery are clunky,as sometimes,when you are so close to a platform and you actually fall off,and because of that, platforming with her is even worse as sometimes ,you need to let go of her in order for platforming,and admittedly pretty solid on Spongebob's part,but the platforming can be tedious because of the bad level design. Also for a licensed game,it does have a lot of replay value,as there are krabby patties in the levels and collecting all of them leads to a bonus level,and it is one of the best parts of the game,as these are fast-paced and fun,as Spongebob rides on a unicycle and collects krabby patties to get a secret item,and these are of the best bonus levels ever,as they have tight controls and great gameplay. The graphics are very good for GBA standards as they resemble the cartoon faithfully,and even have screenshots of episodes prior to the game's release,and considering the limitations of the GBA,that is amazing. The game sounds ok,because while some music sound great,some are very irritating and bothersome,so during the music,I mute it,so overall,the sound is mediocre. Overall,BFBB is a decent game with glaring flaws that pushes down the potential greatness. For a Spongebob fan,I would say rent it,and if you like it,then buy it,but if you're not,then forget about it,and if you want another SB game,then get The console version is appropriate of purchase,The movie game is awesome,and Supersponge is superb.

I didn't like these because the elastic is way too tight on the legs.  It made the leg openings look like diapers and they cut into my skin and there is definitely a visible panty line. The only good thing about them is the fabric is soft.,Not the greatest underwear,B0000AKGHM

It gets rid of the second hand so that its quietness matches the watch's serene combination of silver-and-white tone.  Yet it has the date display to make it useful.

"The Skagen 324LSLC watch is an ultra slim and very elegant time piece.  The watch curves around your wrist with a leather band, and fits comfortably, but will not lay flat due to design.  The watch is water resistant, and I have worn it in the swimming pool and shower with no ill effect, but I would not recommend it on a regular basis due to the leather watch band.  This watch is designed to be worn when you are dressed up for a night on the town, not for running laps around the gym.  Altogether it is a pretty snazzy time piece that is so light you won't even know its on your wrist.",Slim and elegant,B0000C9ZCN
"The style is real nice. But the battery doesn't work. It's either that, or it's short circuited. I had to spend ten dollars just to get it fixed. Right now it's working well.

In fact, this is my second watch as I had the 1st one stolen. Cleaning the glass surface though is not always easy! You might need a special cloth to get rid of even the tiny water drops.

"I finally bought this watch after some disasters with other cool designed watches that had no resistance to water. I chose it because it was listed as 100 meters water resistant but having received it I see that etched into the back it says it is only water resistant to 3 ATM which means, and I quote ""It is tested for water resistance up to 3 ATM, and must be able to survive 30 minutes under water at a depth of 1m (3 feet) followed by 90 seconds under a pressure corresponding to 30 meters"". I assume that this was a typo by Amazon or the vendor of the watch (IE 100 meters was listed instead of 100 feet). I have not tested to see if it holds up will in a shower but I won't expect it to survive unfortunately should I forget to take it off before hand. My last watch (The DUOTIC-D sold through a vender on Amazon) was 3 ATM (listed as water resistant 100ft...or 30 meters..well close enough). When I forgot to take it off before showering it let water in, leaving water spots on the inside of the glass. It then completely failed to work after water penetration a second time when I hand washed the dishes and forgot to take it off!!

This watch is made by a recognizable watch company rather than the Duotic,  which I have seen sold by under many different branded names and vendors, so I am hopeful it will survive as designed (IE 30 mins in 1 meter of water) but its certainly listed wrongly as being more water resistant that it really is. :-(....shame it looks so good. What is it with the watch world!? Form but no function!!, damn shame",Looks great but not 100M water resistant,B0000C9ZCJ

I thought it would be nice to get him a nice watch with a little more cachet than a Timex.  It had to be able to go into our 4 ft deep pool because hubby is too lazy to take it off.  So I found this; water resistant to 100 meters NOT!  The inside of the watch face misted up, end of story.  I returned it and am looking for another uncool but reliable Timex.",Pitiful,B0000C9ZC8
"I have had this watch for many years now, and haven't had any real complaints. It keeps real good time and I've have to replace the battery once a year, which to me is normal. The only reason I gave my review four stars is because of the mesh watch band. I could have been a little longer to fit my wrist. I have the adjustment all the way out, as far as it can go, and it just makes it with a little wiggle room to spare.",It's a real good watch.,B0000C9ZCR
Skagen watches are top notch accessories. Stylish and utilitarian at the same time. This particular watch is an outstanding watch to add to any collection. Its easily adjustable metallic band is great for those who hate watches clunking around on their wrist. The thinness of the watch face is outstanding for use while wearing long-sleeved shirts. The simple elegance of the design is terrific. This is a great product.,Thin & Light,B0000C9ZCR
"I bought this watch and while I love how slim it is I have found two problems.

1. The face is difficult to see in certain light conditions and has no glow for nighttime.

2. The crystal is exposed on the face of the watch and as I have just experienced, it is easy to chip, scratch, or crack.  Replacement from Skagen costs almost $35 and two weeks turnaround and most watch repair stores were quoting a $40-50 repair cost.","Looks nice, but flawed",B0000C9ZCR
"Hi,

I really like this Skagen watch and I have been watching for price drop. It was priced at 95$ and Amazon dropped it to 72$ just couple of weeks back and I just grabbed this good deal.

The wrist band could be easily altered to fit your wrist, the blue dial stands out amazingly with the silver wrist band, Very light weight.

Only issue I have is the metal mesh sometimes catches your wrist hair on your hand :) but maybe if you keep wearing it for few days it should be fine ...

I really like this watch and it's worth the price.

"I bought a Titanium Skagen a few years ago. I've sent it back several times - once for moisture in the case and once it quit running and a new battery wouldn't solve the problem. It was repaired both times in short order for only a postage charge. I bought this 430LSX on impulse at a national discount/overstock brick and mortar store. I like the thinness and simplicity of the Skagen design. Two comments about this site and the one of the reviews. The instructions book (as minimal as it is) says if the watch does not say water resistant then it is not. Amazon claims that this is good to 99 feet. The brochure says: NON WATER-RESISTANT - No marking on watch; WATER RESISTANT 3-5 ATM - Can withstand splashes of water while washing hands or in the rain; WATER RESISTANT 10 ATM - Suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but should not be used for diving. My Titanium 105LTXN plainly says on the back: WATER RESISTANT 100FT. Secondly, to the reviewer that said the watch was too big: The bands are adjustable. You can take links out on either side of the clap to shorten them by a bunch. On the inside of the band you will see small arrows. That tells you which way to push on the extremely tiny ""cotter pins"" on the edge of the band that hold the links together. A diaper pin with the plastic protective head (very sturdy steel) or the smallest of those small screwdriver kits will push them out. It may take A LOT more force than you would think. They go back in from the side they came out, not the side you pushed on. I've sized two Skagens and a Seiko. They are all a little different but same principle. Or have jewler do it for you.",My 2nd Skagen,B0000C9ZDA

"I've had this watch for several years nows. It looks great and I was just what I was looking for. I paid $49.00 for and. There are two things that should be noted here.
1) This watch has a curved face, this means it will more than likely have to be sent out to a have a battery replaced. The jewelry store I deal with along with every other one I could find in the mall could not change the battery. No one had the proper plate used to snap the watch backplate back on. So it had to be sent out.
2) With mine, the watch never seemed to be able to keepo the date on track, it was always lacking behind and always needed reset.",Looks great but can't keep the date!,B0000CARF3

They also use a company that is not reliable/flexible and it took me over 2 weeks to get my watchthat I thought I paid 2 days shipping for.

"I really wanted to like these boots.  I bought them to replace my 20-plus year old Hodgman hip waders that I wore year in and year out fishing streams, rivers, lakes, etc, etc.  I expected to do the same with these.  Unfortunately, as it turns out the soles of these boots weren't up the task of trekking through brush, over trees/branches and through the forest along the river's edge.  At the start of season two I began to notice that my right sock was damp and sometimes a bit wet.  I chalked it up to a sweaty foot or maybe a little splash over the top of the boot, but as I continued to use the boots the dampness got worse.  I inspected the boot with no real luck of finding the hole.  I even went as far as tying off the top of the boot and adding compressed air to fill the boot up while I held it under water - still nothing.  Eventually, I narrowed it down to the shoe area and finally found some punctures in the mid-sole that would only open up as the sole was flexed.  So with every step a little bit of water was introduced to the boot.  I used Gorilla tape to stop the leak for one season, but eventually the other boot followed suite and ultimately the boot bodies started to crack and fail after season two.  Season three I wore them to pass through the trees and brush, but knew that if I set foot in the water my feet would get wet.

I can say they are comfortable, even more so than the Hodgmans I mentioned earlier; mostly because the ""rubber"" on the Pro Line boot is thinner and more malleable.",With every step a little bit of water was introduced,B0000E0C7M

I also wanted a light so I could tell time in the dark.  The only drawback to this watch, as it was everything I wanted, is that the numbers are somewhat hard to see using the Indiglo light.  They don't show up as well as when the actual numbers light up.  This one the Indiglo lights the background and the black numbers aren't as readable as I would like, especially if I have my glasses off, which I do during the night.",timex ladies watch,B0000TIIIW

"Nice watch. Attractive and surprisingly comfortable. I normally avoid expansion band watches because they usually pinch, but I forget I am even wearing this one. It really needs to have the seconds on it though, and the day would also be nice. Working overnights and punching a clock these two features are really important to me. I have gotten another watch to wear to work and am saving this one for my days off. UPDATE. The battery in this watch went dead on me so I purchased a new battery to replace it.  I have never seen any watch as difficult as this one to put a new battery in! I had to remove the watch band and 4 very tiny screws holding the back on to get inside and then the battery was under another covering and didn't just pop out. After finally getting the new battery in, it does not work.  I had the battery (purchased from Amazon) tested and it's fine. I don't understand why watch manufacturers don't make some attractive, economical, full featured digital watches for women. I am able to find many nice affordable watches for men but anything remotely close for women (if you can find it at all) is about five times more expensive. All I want is a digital watch with month/day/date and seconds that has a metal band and is reasonably good looking!  Is this too much to ask?!

"I have two very good watches (Swiss Army and Tissot), but was just browsing in a Target store and really couldn't resist this little watch.  I think this is a great value for a casual watch.  Same thing could be said for many other Timex and Casio watches I'm sure, but this one stole my attention.

First thing, it looks great, very simple and clear face, it is light beige (not white).  Actually, it looks a lot better in person than what you see in this photo here.

Has a nice leather & polypropylene strap, all leather on the inner side by the way, it is remarkably comfortable and very light.  (If you like heavy and bulky watches then this might not be your kind of watch.)  Water resistant down to 50m, quick-date feature, and last but not least, it has the Timex trademark indiglo night-light.

The only minor drawbacks I could find in this watch are: 1) It doesn't have a mineral or sapphire crystal (but hey it's a $25 watch! you won't get those crystals anywhere near this price range anyway); and 2) The tic tac sound is louder than I would have liked.  But those aren't real issues at this price.  If you want tougher crystals, very quiet mechanics, or features like a perpetual calendar or chrono and whatnot etc., you simply have to pay a lot more.

What this unassuming great looking casual Timex watch offers is just good value.",Very good value,B0000TIIS2
"This watch is a real deal.  It is rugged and dependable, waterproof, and very comfortable.  It's very lightweight and is noiseless, so you don't have to worry about a jingle alerting whatever quarry you're hunting.  The watch is attached to the band via an elastic shock-strap that prevents sudden impacts from ripping it off the band.  All in all, a very effective design.  <br />
<br />
The ""quick date"" function assumes there are 31 days in every month, so after the shorter months you need to adjust forward a day or two for it to be correct.  This is no big deal, and is common to most analog watches with this feature.<br />
<br />
My personal experiences with this watch have taken it hunting in all corners of the backwoods of Kentucky, as well as backpacking through the smokies and the titons.  It has proven to be extraordinarily tough.  I had had problems with other watches with the watch coming separated from the band after a tug or strong bump (such as taking off a rucksack and having it's strap catch on the watch bezel), but the elastic loaded shock attachment on this Timex seems to have eliminated those problems.  <br />
<br />
The only down side to this watch that I have found is that the bright-white watch face is quite noticeable at a distance in the woods.  So if you plan to take this watch hunting then make sure it's under a sleeve cuff or it could quite easily give you away.  Otherwise the white face contributes to readability, even for those whose eyesight isn't quite what it used to be.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for an analog, easy to read watch that is tough enough to match your lifestyle, then this just might be the pick.<br />

I was hoping battery will come for at least couple of years. But it lasted for year or so with minimal usage,Battery,B0000TIJ6S
"I had this watch for several years (sadly I just lost it, hence looking for a new watch).  I used it only for the gym, primarily for the chronograph + lap function to time my sets.  Never had a problem and hoped that I'd have it forever.

My only complaint was with the velcro strap.  While it was one of the reasons I chose the watch in the first place, it's a rather impractical design.  First, after a lot of use, it gets fuzz (and dust?) in it, and the end of the strap stops sticking so well, which is just annoying.  Second, when not it use, the velcro strap sticks to other things in my bag resulting in either (1) getting string/lint in the watch's strap (see above), or (2) snagging other items in my bag, such as a delicate shirt (that I had changed from after work).

Though the ""cons"" were annoying, I wouldn't pass up this watch because of them since it's hard to find a quality watch with these functions for a reasonable price.","Great watch, but the velcro strap doesn't last",B0000TIJ6S
"This watch is the BEST watch I have ever owned. There are several Timex Expedition watches that are the ""same"" but different. They are all great. Face colors, face sizes... etc., but the ""works"" of it are the same. The same because YOU CAN'T BEAT IT! I still have one that my father in law gave me because the face was scratched up. He owned it for two years, I had the battery replaced and it works to this day, which is 7 years later I might add.

You will have to have an excuse to replace this watch, so be warned... once you own one of these; it is hard to own others. Easy to read, alarms are awesome, great lighting; the bands never wear out and are comfortable for almost anyone. My skin is sensitive so the plastic bands laying on it give me rashes and irritations.

So, if you like the looks of these watches... I suggest you purchase it. And be prepared to like it all the way into the next election and then some. I just get different colors so I can have the benefits and still match my outfits <grin>!!

"I love this watch. While the velcro strap took me a little while to get used to, I now prefer it over the old leather style of strap. You have more flexibility in getting it to fit precisely right on your wrist instead of being stuck between two buckle holes that only sort of fit.

The screen on the watch is clear and the backlight is very bright. This is the best watch I've had for years. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, durable digital watch.",Favorite Watch,B0000TIJ6S
"I chose this watch because it had a very small face and a brown leather strap.  The face looks great and is the size listed in the description.  However, it only gets 3 stars because the strap I got looks nothing like what is in the product image.  It came with a plain, untextured brown strap that is lighter in color than the one in the product image.  I ordered another, much nicer, watch strap (made by Bulova) to replace it, and now it is my favorite watch!",Watch band not as pictured!,B0000TIIEQ
"When I recieved the watch, I was sad to see that the face was a lot smaller than I expected. Otherwise, the watch had a very nice leather band. Overall I was happy with the quality.",It was ok.,B0000TIIEQ
"So I should've known that the price dictates quality.  The watch is a nice style and fits well on my petite wrist.  But the watch fills with condensation while in the bathroom with the shower on.  This started a couple of weeks after I got it.  It hasn't affected the accuracy of the timekeeping, but it takes a few hours for it to dissipate.",a bit cheap,B0000TEXDG
"I am so glad to see this watch available on Amazon!  I've owned them before, but I'm rough on them!  Nothing else feels right on my wrist except this watch!  I'm a pianist, music teacher, and I also type a lot.  This little watch NEVER gets in the way!  They don't quit until they make it to the washer in a pocket or I fall and break them.  I've been looking for another one just like this for weeks and by chance found it here....  YEA!",I like this watch!,B0000TEXDG
"The watch is beautiful.  The design is perfect for casual wear yet elegant enough to dress up any little evening outfit!  Pair it with a little black dress, and some bling and you are all set.  Then again, a pair of jeans and a tee-shirt and my favorite pair of hiking boots look just fine with it as well.  A very good investment!","Valerie P. from Coarsegold, CA",B0000TEXDG

"The watch has a good classic appearance and feels good on the arm, but after wearing it for several days I found that it would lose about 10 minutes a day. This is not good for a new watch so I returned the watch without any problems.",Looks good --- loses time,B0000TIIFK
"The watch is very readable and easy to see without glasses on. It did deliver with a dead battery which was a bit aggravating since it was a gift. The watch is heavy duty and looks and feels nice on your wrist, but it almost requires a jeweler to take a link out of the wristband",The watch is very readable,B0000TIIFK
This watch is good looking. It has a brilliant chrome plated finish (polished stainless steel). Looks fashionable and sturdy too. The only thing I don't like too much about it is the numbers. They are made of steel and therefore they don't glow in the dark. I tought (by looking at the picture) the numbers were white. Other than that it is a great buy and well worth the money.,A very good buy,B0000TIIFK
"This watch was a gift to my son and all I can say is GREAT. Rock solid and beautiful, I like so much I wanted to keep it for myself. The price is very reasonable and the quality surpasses anything I could hoped for. My son was so pleased with he wants to show it to all the family. He wanted a watch that was classy but not flashy; some thing he could be proud to wear to church and not be afraid to wear working. when you hold it you can feel the solid craftmanship that won't wimp out. Nice, simple, tough, classic looks, and dependable. what else could you ask for.",Classy watch for great price,B0000TIIFK

"The watch was sent to me keeping time poorly. I took it to my jeweler to replace the battery and he said the battery was fine, but they don't work on timex watches, bacauce they are so cheap.

"What a watch:
Tells time - perfectly, so far.
Gold like - handsome and somewhat alluring.
All 12 numerals represented - makes determining the time a cinch.  The crystal is also perfectly clear, also aids time determination.
Goes on the wrist - very convenient.  Clasp closes the watch very well, in fact, maybe the best?
A weighty investment at $15, but should last literally months.

If President Bush had a watch like this, I'd steal it right off his arm.",Timex rocks the timekeeping world,B0000TQIIY
"I could just say ditto to what the other reviewer said.  Her words echo my sentiments.  I wanted another attractive watch whenever my more expensive watch needs a new battery.  I bought this Timex watch through Amazon a few months ago and have been very happy with it.  It's simple but smart-looking and I enjoy using it.

This is an edit to my original review that was dated from 2006.  The review I was referring to (that I agreed with) has suddenly disappeared.  It was dated earlier than my original review.  Just the same, I love this watch and wear it often, not just when my other watch needs a battery.  It may have cost less, but it doesn't look cheap.  I love wearing this classy Timex watch.","Attractive, Functional Watch",B0000TQIIY
"These are so hard to find!!!! I've owned a ton of watches over the years.....few have left as positive an impact as the Reef Gear lineup by timex. I owned the male version of this watch in blue and I bought this exact one for my wife years ago. Almost a decade later she still wears this one and refuses to upgrade to anything because of the turn-n-pull alarm system. That alone makes these watches totally worth it.......turn the crown to the desired minute and pull the crown. One click for alarm, two clicks for anything under 60 mins.....its perfect for anyone who needs to set up reminders or just needs to be reminded when their coffee break is over without having to constantly look at your watch. The rubber strap is very comfortable and this watch is sized just right for a woman's wrist. The blue one blue interior is really striking and unique. At the time of my writing this review there are 2 watches available.......if my wife's broke/got lost today I'd be all over this watch. We've changed the battery once on this watch since new. The indiglo is brilliant and it keeps good time.",PERFECT MINUTE MINDER,B0000UIXYU

"I have had my watch for a couple of weeks now and it's perfect. Small enough to be dainty and ladylike, but easy for my 57 year old eyes to read. I love the light up face, it's very handy when you wake in the middle of the night and are curious to know how many more hours until the alarm clock goes off. The woven leather band is very nice too. Great watch at a reasonable price.

OK, have to say that the Indiglo light stopped working after three months. Tried another battery, still didn't work. Yet I bought another one of these because I need the light at night, hope the next one will be better. Didn't want to bother with returns as I've had this problem before and when the watch came back fixed, the light crapped out again. These used to be more durable when they first came out, not sure what the problem is.","I love this watch,but the Indiglo feature stopped working",B0000UIXWW

"This watch has worked well for us, but the band wore out after only 6 months.  We were in a very dry climate, and that's probably the main reason for this.  Otherwise, it's a good women's watch.  It doesn't look bulky, but the larger numbers on the dial make it easy to read, and the Indiglo works well (even though the product description doesn't mention Indiglo).","Solid, reliable watch.",B0000UIXWW
"I need a watch with big numbers so I can tell time without my reading glasses.  Another requirement is the illumination, so I can see it when I wake up at night in a strange bedroom, and when I go to the theatre or a movie.  The gold hands, however, make it difficult to read, so I switched to the same type of watch, but with dark hands.",Not easy to see,B0000UIXWW
"My wrist broke out in an itchy raised red rash after wearing it for only an hour.  I was very disappointed that the strap was the reason.

"I have been buying Timex watches for years and have always been quite satisfied.  This watch is very nice, but my hand hit a doorway when I was carrying something wide through it and the leather band tore completely off at the pin that holds it to the watch.

"I'm pretty sure this is the same watch I have had for a few years.  I have small wrists to begin with and recently lost some weight so now it is WAY too big even on the smallest hole.  Some people who complain that the other Timex watches are too small should like this one then.  I would have just replaced the band with a smaller one since I love the look of this watch, but it doesn't have the QuickDate feature.  Since every month doesn't have 31 days, you have to manually reset the date every couple months by manually spinning through 24 hours for each day.  It takes awhile, and hurts my fingers to spin the very small dial on the side.  I highly recommend buying a different Timex watch with the QuickDate feature, which allows you to change the date nearly instantly by only pulling the dial out halfway.",No QuickDate feature and strap is too big,B0000UIXWW

"Kenneth Cole Reaction - Digital Watch A126-03-RK5034 Battery is CR2016

This is a customer written manual / tutorial.
This tutorial may be similar to other Reaction Digital watches with 4 buttons.

GENERAL DATA:

The RK5034 is a unique split face digital watch in a heavy metal enclosure.

The Case is 42mm in width, 50cm in length top to bottom, and 15cm in height.

The case is reported to be brass plated with a brushed nickel type of matte, non-gloss surface.

Therefore the main case itself may or may not be solid stainless steel. (it looks like brushed stainless)

The back plate is definitely stainless steel and is removable via 4 screws.

The four buttons, two per side are oval in shape and are shiny chromed metal.

Overall, the watch has a very solid weight and feel and feels good on the wrist.

FEATURES:

It has Time (hours-minutes-seconds), Date (month-day), Stop Watch, and Alarm features.

It has four buttons, 2 on the left, two on the right.

Setting features will likely be very similar to other similar styled digital watches.

The TOP LEFT button is the illumination features which highlights all alpha-numeric figures in blue.

To my knowledge the top left button has no other feature aside from illuminating the LCD display.

The BOTTOM LEFT button is the primary MODE button for viewing and setting all functions.

The watch has three basic functions to view or use:  Time. Date. Timer. Alarm.

The BOTTOM LEFT ""Mode button"" only switches between the Time and stopwatch timer but is also used to engage the setting features.

TO SET THE ALARM:

If needed, first press the Bottom Left MODE button to get to the normal Time function.

Time is always displayed with the hours at top Left screen, Minutes at top Right and seconds in the small box below minutes.

To first see what the current alarm time is, make sure you are in the normal Time Mode then press and briefly hold the BOTTOM RIGHT button.

TURNING ON / OFF THE ALARM:

To Turn ON or OFF the alarm, press and HOLD the Bottom Right Button and simultaneously press the Top Right 1x.

You will see the Alarm Bell Icon Appear or Disappear.

Press these same two buttons again to activate both the Alarm (bell symbol) and or the Hourly Audio Chirp (echo symbol).

In order to hear the Alarm, the Bell Symbol must be shown on the LCD screen. This will let you know the alarm is ON.

The secondary Audible Symbol (echo) gives a brief audio chirp at the top of each hour.

CHANGING THE ALARM TIME:

With the watch in the normal Time function mode, Depress and briefly hold the Lower Left MODE button for three (3) seconds.

Wait until the LCD display begins flashing. When it begins flashing It will first enter into the Alarm Setting mode.

It will first flash the Hours setting to change the alarm hour.

To now change the Alarm Hour, press the LOWER RIGHT button repeatedly to cycle to the desired alarm hour.

Take notice that the A and P will cycle on the lower right screen for AM (A) or PM (P) selection.

Now press the Top Right button to switch edit selection over to minutes.

Now press the Lower Right button repeatedly again to cycle to the desired alarm minutes.

You cannot change seconds so this mode only has two options of Hours and Minutes for the alarm.

When done, repress the LOWER LEFT MODE button once more and you will completely exit the alarm setting mode.

SETTING THE TIME AND DATE:

To now set the time, repress and HOLD the LOWER LEFT MODE button again until it is flashing then repress 1x for 1/2 second.

Therefore the first depress setting mode is for the Alarm. To access the Time Set, hold 3 Sec and then 1x for Time / Date set.

This will now engage the TIME SET mode.

Just as with the Alarm, use the TOP RIGHT button to select Hours, then use BOTTOM RIGHT to set hours.

"I've had this watch for about three years now and always get compliments.  The backlight is a cool blue and it displays in 24 hour format (a must when working with computers) or 12 hour format.

"This is my favourite watch below $5000; subtle, and not overly large, I fell in love with the basic but beautiful styling. Needed 1st battery change after 4 years.
I had my Rado for 5 years before the clasp stopped working, they replaced it for $70. $350 is about the price for the whole strap!
Sadly I lost it, but will be replacing with another Rado! I still haven't found a similarly priced watch which I like as much.",Beautiful Watch,B0000ZH4AO
"I bought a Rado a few years ago, but the band stopped closing  and the jeweler sent it to the factory for a tiny metal piece that serves as a latching post. They wanted $350 to fix it as part of a total overhaul and they refused to only fix the clasp alone -- even though that is all that was in need of repair. Until then it seemed OK but with that kind of factory service I would rather throw it away than be ripped off. I had the entire movement of a Corum coin watch changed from windup to quartz for $275 a few years ago. Rado may not scratch but it will still be a bad investment -- buy a real quality watch brand instead.",Not as good as it should be,B0000ZH4AO

I loved this watch for as long as it lasted - the time started going wacky at 11 months despite the fact that new battery was installed.  Three months later when the watch was just over a year old the strap went to jelly and the now it's just one long slit so there is nothing for the catch to hold on to so the watch is useless.

"I really like my MSN watches and the service as a whole. It is a real shame that Microsoft has chosen to stop supporting the service in 2012. I have had 4 of these MSN watches since 2003 when they were introduced. They are a great conversation starter, and the different services like news and weather and movie showtimes are great things to have access to especially on a watch. On the downside, the watch is not waterproof in any sense of the word, so you cannot even shower with it on. The battery life is about 3 to 4 days between charges and if you forget to charge it when the battery dies, the display screen goes completely blank without any real warning. But all in all its a pretty good watch. (Once MSN stops the services it will still at least display the time and date....)",msn watch,B000153MWW
"This is pretty much a dead product although Microsoft still supports the system.  I got this as it was still one of the few still being made for the MSN system.

To my knowledge, no one still makes these devices.",Look Further,B000153MWW
"I was quite interested in having a 'news ticker +' on my wrist all day.  I would like to say that the MSN Direct service is pretty good for what is is meant to do, and that is provide interesting information in an otherwise boring day.

BUT- Fossil needs to figure out what is wrong with the Wrist net watches.  Like clockwork, I have had to return two (and as of tonight, three) of the Wrist net-Round watches for the exact same symptoms.  The watch will 'reboot' itself randomly prohibiting your ability to tell time until a signal is again received.  The event seems to occur approximately 45-55 days after you activate the watch.  Perhaps it is just circumstancial, but it is the exact pattern that I have encountered three times over.  I hope the warranty will cover and honor my third claim, as the warranty only covers a 90-day period and I was told ""Oh yea, this is happening alot with those.""

If you must have MSN Direct, consider other brands. I cannot recomend the Fossil/Abacus watch line.",3rd defective and counting...,B000153MWW
"This is perhaps one of the most innovative (yet imcomplete) inventions since the watch (time piece).  Incomplete in that, it is also the most unconfortable thing to where.  Not to mention very bulky.  A leather (or some kind of elastic) band would have solved all of that.  I returned it in one week.  ...did I mention it needed a leather band. Oh yeah, LEATHER BAND PLEASE.",Functional but Unconfortable,B000153MWW
"The short story---I returned the watch 3 days after receiving it.
Now here's the long versino.
Originally, this watch had been on my Christmas list, and so it was with great anticipation when it finally showed up at my door on January 19th.
I opened the box, followed the directions and immediately signed up for the $59 MSN Direct Annual subscription (mistake #1). Within about 20 minutes, I had my MSN channels setup, and I was receiving signals and the watch was working fine. Setup was quick and easy.
I waited until the next morning, after letting the watch charge overnight, to try and get it on my wrist---much as I tried, the watch was just too clunky to fit suitably on my wrist. Now when I ordered it, I realized the watch wasn't going to be a fashionable one---but at this point, its clunkiness really bothered me and made me doubt my purchase. It was just either too loose or too tight.
Second problem. I follow a group of about 20 fairly large size companies on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Only 3 of them were available on the Stock channel of MSN Direct. And there seemed to be no rhyme or reason. 2 mid sized companies and one small company were all I could add to my Stock Watch list--leaving me 17 short.
Third problem. I realized I wasn't getting any Sports information displayed on the watch. Guess what? The Sports Channel is coming soon...
For nearly $200, plus a $59 annual subscription to MSN Direct, I expected to be able to get up to the minute Stock reports and Sports in addition to the News and Weather channels. Unfortunately, I couldn't, and so I returned the watch.
Amazon refunded my money yesterday (minus the shipping charges since the return was 'my fault').
I've been trying to get Microsoft to refund my $59 with less success. They claim they have issued me a credit card refund, but all I have on my credit card statement is a charge for the annual subscription and now a new monthly charge for the service. I'm about to make my 3rd phone call to them.
In summary, for me anyway, the watch didn't fit, and the MSN Direct Service didn't meet my expectations.","Sorry, not quite ready for prime time...",B000153MWW
"I live in Chicago at the very edge of the coverare area.  I found the watch setup to be quite easy and configuring channels via MSN Direct is easy as well.  It took a bit of time before the data started flowing to the watch, but once the initial ""download"" was complete it updates quickly.  The screen is very readable even for news articles, which is remarkable given the screen small size.  The watch is a bit bulky, but given all the it does (time, stop watch, alarm, news, weather, calender and appointments) it is pretty amazing.  I have loaded the Outlook addin that allows appointment to sent from Outlook to the watch.  This is very, very cool.  I really love my smart watch.",Smart Watch!,B000153MWW
"I'm a techno-geek, and become interested in any new device that features a microprocessor of some sort.  After reading posts and reviews across the web about the Microsoft SPOT watches, I finally decided to take the plunge.  I am absolutely delighted with my purchase, and am finding it far more useful than just a simple geek-gadget.
I love the fact that my Outlook calendar syncs with the watch.  Sure, a PDA an serve the same puprose, but I hate carrying a PDA everyhwere I go.  Plus, the SPOT watch is automatically updated within minutes of making a change to my calendar.  No cradle or hotsync required...the watch udpates wirelessly while it's sitting on my wrist, anywhere I might be in the local area.  My wife can update my calendar to let me know she wants to have dinner tonight, and it would show up on my watch while I'm at work.  Personally, I think that's pretty amazing.  When an appointment time nears, it pops up on the watch along with a countown timer (in 15min, 14min, etc...).  Neat!
Stock updates are great also...a quick glance at my watch tells me how my stocks are doing today.  Again, all wirelessly no matter where I might be.  While the quotes are somehwat delayed (maybe 30min), still useful for keeping general track of how you might be doing for the day.
Everything was easy to set up, the watch really isn't much bigger than my Seiko (though I have big hands and wrists), and I don't find anything about the watch's materials to be cheap at all.  First time charging went smooth as silk, and set up took 5 min with content arriving on the watch within 30 min of activation.  Charging is cool to...you just set the watch on the included charging stand (I do it when I go to bed at night).  No wires to plug in or anything...the watch charges by induction.  A full charge is supposed to last 3-5 days, but I guess that would only come into play when going out of town.  Of course you must take the charger with you, so that's a bit of a hassle I suppose.
Overall this is a great watch and represents some cool new technology.  As far as service charge goes, I don't find $59 for 12 months to be unreasonable at all.  If you want to buy the watch and try it out, you can sign up for monthly service and get the first month free, then switch to yearly.  That way if you decide to return your watch, you won't be stuck with the service.",Not just a gadget...more useful than expected,B000153MWW
"Pros
-Use it like a pager
Only those who you let know your email can send you messages
For $59/year, not too high cost for the option. Users of MSN can send as many messages they want, with several lines of text.
-Better than a PDA if you're looking for just a calendar
Less clunky, easy to synch with Outlook. Great for someone who would rather carry around a watch, than a PDA.
-Great for News / Weather / Stock Hounds
Keeps you updated on the latest of all three, and does it very well. Even gives you tiny stock chart.
-EXTREMELY easy to set up.
Cons
-No ability to communicate with others
Calendar/Month view doesn't show notations or offer ability to move through month view.
-Large (not for women at all! unless you're big boned)
-Not as many channels as I would like to choose from
-Stopwatch/timer feature not as advanced as it could be
Overall, for the price, it's not bad, especially if you like to be an early adopter. And it shows lots of promise. Had no problem in an office building in Alaska receiving messages. Some people may end up getting 'early lemons', which I assume is the reason for the other bad reviews.
It's perfect for technology challenged types who would like to have a pager, cell phone and PDA, but really doesn't need all the overkill and hates being 'electronically chained' to a cell phone. PERFECT for delivery people!","It's new, so...",B000153MWW
"No, this won't replace your cell phone, and you can get more current info off the internet, but if you want to have sport scrores or stock quotes or brief news items available to you wherever you are, at the push of a few buttons, then this might be for you.
For me, the two most useful items are perfect time-keeping, linked to US national standard time, and MSN messaging.
I don't leave my cell phone on, and I don't give out the cell number, because I hate it when people think I'm at their beck and call.  But this gives me the ability to get some messages, at MY convenience, wherever I am.  A lot like email, but portable, and on MY terms.
I bought one at CES from the Fossil booth, and it took all of 20 minutes to register it, set up preferences and get my first message.
One small note:  the antenna in the Fossil watches is in the watchband, so you're stuck with the watchband they provide.  Suunto makes a SPOT watch with the antenna in the watch's rim, so you can change bands.  They lose a little reception strength due to the smaller antenna, but it's a trade off.
As far as the Fossil's reception -- I've had good reception in places (like buildings) where my cell phone doesn't see signal.  That's all I can ask.
The watch has a rechageable battery.  THe claim 2 days between recharges, but, even with my excessive new-toy usage, I still had 35% battery after 3 days, so a good 3 days is a better estimate.
Oh, the bulk of the watch isn't as bad as some say, although the fx-3000 model is bigger.  I have a Nike sports watch that is substantially larger.",Pretty amazing for what it is,B000153MWW

"OK, I did my homework... researched extensively in as many web sites as I could, for reviews and ratings, and finally decided to go for it and get the watch with the most favorable reviews (Fossil, Square Face).  What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!

Seriously, the watch is scaringly ENORMOUS!! As in UNWEARABLY BIG (over 1/2 and inch thick!! 2 inches long!! 1.5 inches wide!! WOW!!!)... my wife and I actually laughed when I took it out of the box!  It looks like some kind of weapon or wearable instrument (sci-fi movie like), but definitely not like a watch.  G-Shocks are considerably smaller than these!!!  I do not know how big the other reviewers--with favorable ratings--are, but I can tell you that on a 5'7"" person like me (average height of the population in the planet, and the one used in ergonomics designs), it looks like a bad joke.  Good luck if you wear long sleeved shirts!

But, since the gargantuan thing had arrived, I decided to, at least, test its functionality. After all, that is why I got the watch on the first place.

My funcitonality test endeded when reading the MSN Direct service agreement's ""fine print"".  There are so many provisions AGAINST the user, that it is actually fun to read: they take no responsibility, whatsoever, for any service disruption or if the service does not work at all (and will charge you anyways)... they limit the number of instant messages and calendar notes AND will charge you MORE MONEY for receiving more than the limit (which is not stipulated ANYWHERE in the agreement--scary!)... there are no refunds WHATSOEVER, for any reason... there is no clarification if the ""first month free"" is the same ""trial period"" mentioned in the contract or not, so I could not tell if after testing the service for less than a month and cancelling it, I would still be charged the yearly fee (as in other services, ""first month free"" could mean that the yearly service cost is for 11 months + 1 ""free"" month... where the latter is NOT a trial period, but a package deal)... and it goes on and on... NO WAY I AM SPENDING AN EXTRA SIXTY BUCKS FOR A SERVICE I WILL POSSIBLY NEVER GET!!!

This puppy is going back to the store, I'll just wait a few more years till the technology matures and someone other than MSN, with a true concept of ""service"", offers and alternative solution.  On the meantime, back to my old, faithful Tissot and my cell phone... which together, do more than these watches ever could.","Nice idea, HUGE watch, HORRIBLE service agreement",B000153MWM

Excellent, Windy today, humidity, just look at your watch. Excellent. You do have to have a subcription for 60 a year. but its worth it. Your also able to change the face of your watch. COOL!",Loved it!,B000153MWM
"Given all the negative words written about these watches, I thought I'd chime in with a positive review (and no, I do not work for Fossil or Microsoft).
I love it.  Period.  After wearing my Wrist Net Square for the past couple of weeks I can't imagine wearing a simple ""watch"" anymore.  Being able to glance at my wrist and have access to news, stocks, weather, IMs, and my Outlook calendar appointments is nothing short of amazing.  And yes, I do own a wireless-enabled PDA and cellphone, but there are plenty of times when using them is inappropriate or inconvienient.  Mind you, keeping your expectations grounded in reality is helpful.  You're not going to be receiving the entire NY Times on these watches, nor will they serve double duty as dedicated Bloomberg Stock feeds.  If, however, you're looking for quick updates and news alerts, SPOT can't be beat.  The display is crisp and clear, the backlight can double as a flashlight in a pinch, and the ability to change watch faces depending on mood/situations is a nice touch.  Of course, it also functions quite nicely as a watch, with all the usual features present: dual alarms, stopwatch/lap timer, countdown timer, dual time...
True, the band can be a bit of a pain to adjust, but it certainly doesn't require a trip to your local jeweler.  Just use a thumbtack to push the pin in, and you're good to go.  Now that mine is sized correctly, it's actually quite comfortable - and I have thin wrists for a guy, in spite of the fact that I'm six feet tall and weigh 170lbs.
My advice to potential buyers:  Don't cheap out, get a Fossil Square, Round, Dick Tracy, or Suunto.  They won't crap out on you, and at least in the case of the Square, it actually looks cool (I've never received so many compliments on a watch - and that's before people see what it does).  Also, be sure that you live in a supported area, and do not sign up for the yearly plan.  You get a free month's service, so use it.  See if the watch is useful to you before you commit to longer contract.",A LOT more than the time...,B000153MWM

"Was looking for a neoprene sock for caving.  My issue with socks and footwear is that I am a womens size 5 so there isn't a lot of gear out there for me.  I was quite tickled to find that these came in an extra small which supposedly fit size 4 to 5.

I was quite disappointed to find that is no way close to true as they are huge on my feet.  Will I be able to use them?  Probably.

"After reading other customer reviews, I bought these socks to wear under my Keen water/hiking shoes to hike into the Narrows at Zion's Canyon.  I wear a size 6 shoe so ordered the small.  I should have ordered the extra small, as they run quite large.  They were about an inch too long and bunched up at the ankle.  I did not have time to return and reorder, so just wore them.  After getting wet in barely 2 inches of water they stretched out even more and were worse at the ankles. The socks are definitely not waterproof.  However, my feel were never cold and the feel is very good.

I am giving them 3 stars...the quality is great and comfortable, but not true to size.  Maybe mine were sized incorrectly.  So for these reasons, I personally would not order another pair.",After getting wet in barely 2 inches of water they stretched out even more and were worse at the ankles,B0001N5TDY

"While I love the design concept, and it served me reasonably well for a week in Grand Teton National Park, there were some unfortunate quality issues. First, the snap-able left shoulder flap had its snap come loose from the vest side (tore out), presumably from my camera or tripod strap catching on it during hiking. Certainly, this occurred from nothing more than expected wear and tear.  This happened in the first day or two.  Next, the large front right zippered pocket had a blow out.  Luckily, no gear was lost, but the silky polyester liner inside this pocket was found to be super thin/cheap.  In fact, the overall vest's cotton material is a bit too thin in general.  I would love this vest, if it were only made more durable.  In this case, I would have returned it after having these problems with only a week's normal wear, but I missed my return window.

"I'm a long-time Timex Data Link watch wearer. I love the idea of having a sports watch and my data combined. I bought the first Data Link made and loved it. But when we got new LED screens, Timex opted to make it so we couldn't use the software, making the data part of the watch virtually worthless.

My original watch is still working. I liked the way you went from one contact to another. It was a simple watch and had lots of good features that were easy to use.

This current watch lasted about a year and a half and went down for good. I'm replacing it with a Timex sports watch. The watch eats batteries too.

This newer model Data Link does not have the rich features of the original. It doesn't tell you when the battery is low. It's more difficult to get from one contact to another. And, as I discovered, they don't last long. At least mine didn't. It lasted through the warranty and that's about all.

I now have contacts on my cellphone and in my Palm so, while I loved having them on the watch, I can live without it. I really need time alarms and the timing features of the sports watch.

So those are the trade offs. Did I get a lemon? It's possible. But this was my experience. I may get a Data Link again. But it will be if they really do a terrific upgrade.

I find this newer version to be much more convenient as I usually upload things such as occasion or contacts on a more or less weekly basis. I use medications and I find the alarm settings for that is easy. Instructions for each type of setting are clear on the monitor and to use the watch for other titles is relatively easy for example I am not very athletic so I converted one title so I have Business Contacts and the normal Contacts are personal friends and relatives.

"It seems non-sensical to have both ""water resistant to 99 ft"" and ""withstands splashes and rain not submersion"" in the description. which is it? Can't be both. I have owned my first for 23 years, my second for 19 and I get these here for friends who are not Amazon members. Lately the pin they use for the lid is not the same quality as years ago. It is not as rounded at the ends thus not as smooth and secure to open and close. Just recently repair told a friend that it would cost near $250 (retail is $265) to fix his lid. Who are they paying to do the work? It used to be that a cleaning was $35, I fear to know what it is now. The band is quite overpriced at $35 your local watch repair may not be Seiko certified, and that makes a difference to repair, but they probably have really nice band for $25. However, as the only other quality braille watch is ARSA is Switzerland and they do not respond to repair inquiries this seems to be our middle choice. Always a performer.

Even when the temperature started to climb, I didn't feel uncomfortable as long as I rolled the sleeves up.

I ordered a 9 and hoped they would not be too tight when I put them on.  These boots felt and fit better that any boot I ever bought in a store.  And that would be after trying 6 or 7 pair.

"If you want a steel toe cowboy boot that looks like a cowboy boot, this and a couple other options from Double H seem to be the sum total of your choices across the entire broad spectrum of boot manufacturers.

On the plus side, it looks like a cowboy boot should, and it has a good walking heel, and good tread.  The leather was very soft, and they were as comfortable as they could be immediately, with no miserable break-in period.  They were marked very prominently with Made in USA, and appear to be of fully domestic manufacture.

On the more neutral side, it's sad that we've reached the point where something affordable that's made in America is almost by definition going to be of inferior quality to something foreign.  It is what it is.  I've lost a couple of trucking jobs due to the imported stuff from China and Vietnam vastly surpassing American-made stuff with American people working in American factories for American wages with American environmental regulations trying to make a price-competitive product, and ultimately going out of business for their effort.  The days when foreign meant crappy are over, and the tables have, sadly, turned.  Made in America at a reasonable price point means made cheap, because Americans are expensive to pay, American society is litigious, American insurance is expensive, and the only way to cut costs is on materials and workmanship.  This is very apparent in these boots, which have a cheap, Made in Taiwan look about the low quality stitching and poor finish work.  In of itself, it's excusable, since they're boots meant for working that are going to get banged up and dirty, and at least you're helping to employ Americans.

On the negative side, I decided to wear these boots to work after trying them on and walking around in them for awhile.  They were not immediately uncomfortable, but after putting in a 12 hour shift I would have been willing to use a Dremel tool to cut the wretched things off my feet at the end of the day if I hadn't been able to pull them off.  I wear an 11 EE in pretty well everything, but 11 EE in these boots is MUCH too narrow for my toes.  The steel toe cap is the entire problem, and were it not for that, I'm sure they would stretch out just enough to accommodate my feet.

Since there is no stretching steel, the only choice is to go with a bigger size, but as they fit perfectly in every other respect, I would expect a larger size to be unacceptably loose in a pull-on boot.  I would try an 11 EEE if I wanted to gamble another $150, but I don't feel that lucky.  My daydreams of wearing a true high-heel western style boot to work are obliterated, and I will be buying something entirely different and much uglier in the interest of not suffering in pain every day 60 hours a week.

I'm very disappointed, but it has as much to do with my wide feet as anything else.  There is probably a reason why I get along so well with my various square-toe Ariats.  I have to say the Ariats felt like putting on angel feathers after wearing these torturous monstrosities around for just one hour today.  If only Ariat made a decent looking cowboy-style boot in a steel toe.  I hate having to wear steel-toe boots, but it is what it is.","Looks good, but...",B00024U0IG

"With a name like Expedition, one would expect this watch band to stand up to the rigors of travel and adventure in the most exotic of locales. Well, it is certainly stylish and attractive enough to appear in a National Geographic photo shoot, but will likely fall off of the wearer's wrist as soon as the cameras are off! I purchased the item last year as a spare and put it into service this spring. After four months of use, it tries to fall off even when I'm sitting still. The velcro strip did not provide a very vigorous closure when it was brand new and it steadily lost its grip even further over time.

This band was made specifically for Timex so it matched up perfectly. The watch attaches to the band on an elastic strip so if the watch gets snagged on something, at work or play, it doesn't pull off your wrist like a standard watchband would. The Velcro seems much more substantial than the average stuff found on other products as well.

I've worn this band for about a month and so far it has been outstanding.",Versatile and durable,B00024WL8S
I've had one of the leather/cloth combo bands for years.  It doesn't seem to be made anymore.  This was the closest in color to what I had before.

"Easy to use and customize watch stap.  The material that connect the watch to the strap is easy to cut and is flexiable.  Even if the watch connection points do not exactly match the band it is easy to cut to match your watch.  The extra flex is helpful if the watch snags on something, it can flex, so your hand gets less of a jerk.

The strap itself is tough and with the velcro connection will fit just about any person.  Please note that this is good velcro, so you can almost hang your body from this watch strap.",Watch Band,B00024WL8S
"I bought this same strap about 8 years ago to replace the regular watchband on my expedition.  I love this strap, since it keeps the watch close to my wrist and doesnt let it slide around, yet is hard to over-tighten like a regular strap.  Also, you can losen it it wear it further up your arm if elastic-cuffed sweatshirts bother you with a watch on (like they bother me).  The best thing I like about this type of strap is the elastic band that holds the watch. I work on vehicles quite often and I found this feature keeps the watch body from getting ripped from the strap (it will stretch or flip over before breaking the elastic or pins) when fitting your hand into tight spaces.  That's how my original band broke since there is no ""give"" built in.

After so many years this band has started to deteriorate, and I think I've used it well past several of its lifetimes.  The elastic is stapled and taped to keep it tight and the leather velcro cover piece is crazy glued on since the stiching has long since broken.  The webbing has held up exceptionally well, as has the velcro itself, which is why I haven't bought another one yet.  When one of those materials start to go, I'll break down and get another band.  I switched from this band to a cheaper imitation one for about a week before that one broke and I decided to make repairs to this one.  If you like this type of band, buy a real Timex, not a knock-off.",Great Band,B00024WL8S

"I loved the look and the size of this watch, and the fact that it was water-resistant.  However, within 3 weeks it stopped working.  It may have needed a new battery, but I wasn't interested in having to get a replacement for a brand-new watch, particularly because there was a second problem: the color was starting to wear off the strap in spots.  At least this happened within Amazon's 30-day return period.  It's been returned.

I was skeptical at first buying a watch from Inventory Adjusters but it was a good experience.  I verified the watch through Raymond Weil as authentic and registered it through there website.

"Nourhan Sharif, top notch world reknown dancer, and her husband and choreographer, Yousry Sharif, are truly gems in the crown of Middle Eastern dance. Not only are they insanely talented and well-trained, but they have a gift for teaching technique. They teach clearly, building not a choreography but an entire vocabulary of moves that you can then turn into your own performance. If you want real training and authenticity, then this is the video for you.",Top notch technique training!,B0002HDH10
"This dvd is excellent for teaching foundations of cane dancing or Raqs Assaya. Any Bellydancer interested in learning cane technique will find this useful.

The dvd contains stretches for the wrist, exercises for developing an awareness of your cane, a variety of steps, cane twirling technique, using the cane to frame the body and movements, several combinations, traveling steps, finales and a demonstration/performance by the instructor.  The combinations are shown from a variety of angles so you can see what it looks like from the back as well as front.

The instructor, Nourhan Sharif, provides good instruction for an intermediate level dancer. She teaches in a practice outfit that allows the viewer to clearly see what her legs, hips, midriff and arms are doing. She also demonstrates the moves in a way the communicates the joy, energy and playfulness that originally attracted me to Raqs Assaya. Those who learn well by visual example will appreciate this dvd.

I already knew some saidi cane dancing technique and had performed with a cane before viewing this dvd. However I still learned new moves and more importantly better technique for dancing with and manipulating a cane. I can now twirl the cane with either the right or left hand thanks to the technique in this dvd. (I didn't have the coordination in my left hand previously.) I also found the framing techniques useful for incorporating the can into a dance rather than just using it for a few cute tricks.

Here are a few things I would have liked to have seen in this or a future dvd: A tutorial on appropriate music and the rhythms, a choreogrpahy, a little on the history/cultural background of this style, more presentation/performance suggestions (though some are peppered throughout the dvd), some advice on selecting a cane.

Those are just little wishes, overall the information is useful and well explained. For those who enjoy learning solid technique from their dvds this is excellent. Those who want to learn choreography might be disapointed, however you can use the information to create your own choreography. Also, this dvd refers to the instructors dance technique and uses terminology from her technique without explaining. I am not familiar with her other instruction, but I still found the dvd useful.

Saidi and Assaya dancing can be very aerobic, though this is not a workout dvd. I would encourage dancers to warm up before following the dvd. The dvd does not include a detailed warm up, but it does have excellent streches for the wrist and forearms.

This dvd is probably most appropriate for intermediate to advanced dancers since it references a variety of moves such as 3/4 shimmies without explaining the moves. The cane technique such as holding the cane, cane twirls, etc. could be useful to less experienced dancers who have mastered basic movements and these dancers can grow into some of the more complicated moves and combinations as they learn more dance steps.",A Great Resource,B0002HDH10
"On last December I performed with cane (Assaya), but with Nourhan's DVD I have learn many movements that I have never seen in Panama before.

Nourhan Sharif presents a very important tool for students and also for teachers, and with this DVD you can practice also basic steps of belly dance. If you practice you can prepare your own choreography....

I hope that the Assaya Choreography DVD, can be in the market soon....ASAP???",Assaya dance,B0002HDH10
"First things first, dancing with a cane is just fun. It is one of the more affordable props, ranging from $4.00-$25.00 a piece, and it is as much fun to do as it is to watch. You learn to layer the cane over bellydance moves. You will learn to use the cane to frame your body and accent hip work, shimmies, chest moves, figure eights, etc. You are shown stretches for your wrists, to warm them up and prevent injury, and the movements are broken down, so they are easy to follow. I recommend this video for any bellydancer interested in learning cane, or any prop for that matter. It is important to remember that like most moves in bellydance, most of the time it looks easier than it is. If it is a little challenging at first, don't worry. Stick with it and practice, and you can learn it.",Give it a try,B0002HDH10

If the watch had been working it would have been all right. Kind of a nice design. I used to have an Armitron analog/digital that I loved, but they discontinued that excellent design, so I took a chance on another one.

"These boots are beautifully crafted, but they are not for everyone. They are narrow, as past reviewers mentioned. I am a 9B, so they are great, but for those who are used to a roomier footbed), these boots may not be for you. I also am a bit puzzled by the tongue of the boot. It seems to be crafted on a slight angle and to not lay as flat as I expected when the boot is laced up. I was concerned that it would cause unnecessary rubbing of my ankle. I have now worn these boots a number of times to break them in and soften the tongue so it molds better to my ankle. There are real pluses to the boot. It is attractive, durable and has the stiffer sole I require to protect my arches. I am looking forward to wearing these boots for years to come.",Danner boot for women-- sizing and fit,B0002L4O2W

The problem is the lining. It wrinkles near the top of the tongues.

I guess it feels that way because there IS something there: extra material...rubbing away...

They are still repairable, but for $181 for a new pair, versus about $100 to fix the old ones, I thought I'd try these. They took about a day to break in, which probably had more to do with the hard heel inserts they came with. I realized I found them too hard for my feet, replaced them with a different pair of inserts, and, voila, just as comfortable as my old pair! I wear my boots for work and hiking, and have never found a better, more well-made, or more comfortable pair of boots! Danner's are a bit expensive, but they are so worth it! I work in intermittently wet conditions, and my feet stay comfortable and dry all day. Danner's also seem to conform to your feet after wearing them for a short time, but they don't stretch out. I have very wide feet, and although EE Danner's feel a little snug when you first put them on (and they don't look wide), they quickly form around your feet for a perfect fit. I can't say enough good things about these. Danner's are the ONLY boots I will ever work in or hike in!",nothing less that expected,B0002L4ARQ

"UPDATE 2:  (One year later)
I'm still wearing these boots almost every day.  They have held up very well.  They are still completely waterproof.  The soles are in excellent shape.  They are moderately comfortable.  I put some expensive sole inserts in them which helped with comfort significantly.  The leather is still garbage in my opinion.  After a little internet searching, I have come to conclude that these are made with bonded leather.  (Do an internet search if you aren't sure what that means.)  For the price, that's completely unacceptable.  Lastly, I still submit that these are not ""insulated"", but ""lined"".

UPDATE:
I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear, so this is an update after 6 months of wear.  This is my first pair of Danner boots.  I wear them everyday, sometimes all day.  They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office.  I have had them in water.  I have provided no care (polish, oil, waterproofing, etc.)  Overall, I am disappointed in these boots for the price.  I bought them because they are ""Made In The USA"" and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction.  I don't see that happening with these boots for me.  These are well crafted, but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.

APPEARANCE:
They look just as they do in the image.  The image provided is representative.  I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients.  I haven't tried to polish them, yet.

LEATHER:
Very Poor!!  At first, I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary.  However, this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in.  Additionally, they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather.  It almost seems like a latex paint.  Because of this, the coloring is unnatural appearing.  Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel.  It doesn't take long to realize this is merely superficial.  It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use.  The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college.  I bought these boots to last me for years.  They're not going to make it.  The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.

OUT-SOLES:
Best thing about the boots.  Quality Vibram soles as you would expect.  They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar, but more dense than that found on running shoes.  The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer.  This has worn very well.  I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.

LACING:
5 eyelets, 4 hooks, 1 eyelet.  Simple.  The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots.  There have been no problems keeping them laced up.  Once tied up they stay that way for the day.

INSIDE:
They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer's foot and the Gore-tex.  It seems to be holding up well.  There aren't any leaks.  I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two.  They come with a heal-cup type insert.  This is made of a soft plastic material.  The inserts are annoying in that they have to be re-positioned every time you put the boots on.  Note, these are not insulated boots.

COMFORT and SUPPORT:
Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support.  The cushioning in the sole contributes to that.  I find the heal inserts to help.  I haven't tried them without the inserts.  But, frankly, these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot--especially for that price!  On the one 5 mile hike I did with these, they didn't cut it.  My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support.  Admittedly, these are not hiking boots, but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.

SIZING:
They seem perfectly true to size and width.  There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box, but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.

PRICING:
Far overpriced for the materials.

Sadly, I'll never buy Danner again.  I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials.  Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these.",Poor materials,B0002L4ARQ
"I have been chasing grouse, pheasant and quail (when we used to have them) all over Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and South Dakota for 30 years. I have had numerous boots over the years, Red Wing, Cabela's Kangaroo, Rocky, Irish Setter,etc. I have had some good ones but nothing compares to this Danner boot. I wanted something that wouldn't take long to break in and I preferred something made in America. I got both with this boot. They felt like a 10 year old boot the first time I wore them .... that's a good thing. Pretty pricey but I don't jack around when it comes to my feet.",Best boot ever.,B0002L4ARQ
"Got my boots to go hunting just a day before leaving for the trip.  Hoped they would not require break-in as other reviews suggested, and indeed, they fit great on my narrow (A/B width) feet and were flexible and comfortable right out of the box.  I did insert Super Feet orthotics in lieu of the provided half-orthotic.  It does slightly increase the height of your foot in the boot to do so, but I like the comfort and extra arch support I get with the orthotics, and didn't cause any fit problems for me.  If I had any sort of quibble with the boots, it would just be that they don't have padding at the top like the Danner's Trophy boots, but it's nothing that socks with some pad on the leg (I use snowboard socks) won't solve.  So far, they've help up well in rocky and uneven terrain, and my feet weren't tired like they usually are after trudging around all day.  A great investment, as I expect these pair to last me for decades (and be repairable/resole-able with the stitch-down boot) , unlike my last pair where the synthetic midsole just disintegrated after about 10 years.",Great Boots Out of the Box,B0002L4ARQ

when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l. 71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been

$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.

It looks like a 20buck watch and that's what it cost.",plastic watch but fine for the price,B0002M9SFE
"plusses

+ two time zones apart from the analog time, that way you can have two alarms and one really useable alternate time zone (since the alarms are dependant on the digital time, one digital time is wasted as it would have to be exactly corresponding to the analog time)

+ I like that this does not use the crown wheel, which is supposed to be a 'feature' of many other Timexes but is actually a big pain to use.

minuses

- the digital display is a bit small and the shadow from the dial falls on it, making it a little hard to read

- the second time zone can have a different hour, date, day but not a different minute (I find this really stupid, but most Timexes have this problem)

- the strap looks cheap.

- does not have the FLIX feature.

- all alarms correspond to the digital time. This means that if you want the alarm to ring at say 7 am, your analog time and the digital time zone 1 have to be exactly the same so that when the analog time is 7 your digital time is also 7 and the alarm rings. I would have liked the alarms to correspond to the analog time alone, so that i can truly have independant time zones in the digital display. But this is problem with most combo Timexes I checked out.

- liked the black dial in the 44442 better",A good watch,B0002M9SFE

"Worst quality out of all 12 Timex Ironman watches I've owned.
Small melted spot on case looks like it touched something hot at the factory.  The START LAP button only works if you push it very hard.  The band is very scratchy and irritating.  It's like having a wool sweater on my wrist.  The IndiGlo is dimmer than any other watch I've ever owned.

I've been wearing Timex Ironman watches since 1998, and I mean 24/7.  I basically buy one and wear it all the time including showers, swimming, working (manual labor) working out, etc.  I've had them last as little as six months or as long as 2 years.  Usually by the time the strap breaks the face is all scratched up, the paint is worn off the plastic and it's just time for a new one.  A couple of times I've had water get in and ruin the watch.  Once I had the plastic casing of the watch crack.  My point is I'm an experienced purchaser and user of Timex Ironman watches and this one is the shoddiest I've ever had.  The START LAP button doesn't even work unless I mash it.

The watch looks pretty nice.  No glaring gaudy colors.  Nice silver and black.  Understated, visually.

I keep buying Timex Ironman watches because at least they have all the features I'm used to and which I use all the time.  I suppose I could just wear this one until it craps out, but it's just so uncomfortable.  The band material looks like they made it out of some kind of high tech breathable fiber but in reality it's just some kind of knitted plastic thread that feels abrasive on my arm.

"As a confirmed watchaholic, I write with the experience of owning many watches. Purchased in Sept., 2007, my Timex Chrono has been a superior watch to many I've had, costing many times more. I believe a watch must look good, show me the time and date(correctly) when asked, then go wherever my arm takes it until it's called upon again. I'm tough on my watches, careful but tough. This Timex has survived snow-blowing, lawn mowing and other home improvement projects-never skipped a beat! The crystal does not scratch easily nor does show wear. It's just as at home looking out from under a suit jacket. Not one to solicit comments from strangers, people have actually asked what kind of watch it is, they've said it looks great(and expensive), can't believe it's a Timex! That's not a bad thing, maybe they'll start thinking differently. Last thing, this Chrono will NOT be lost on your arm if you are a rather large fellow!

"I'm very happy with my new timex, Im glad to be the first person that writes a review for this watch. First I have to say that my first impression for this watch after I bought it was that I found it to big for me, but after a few days I found it perfect, and It looks better now that in this picture. I expend like two weeks looking around for something like this, a crhrono watch with also a indiglo light system. So if you are looking for a great watch try this one.  The cons I found for it is: the weight and that timex its an special watch, the configuration of the chrono its not that simple the first time you use it.

Finally I just have to say that this is a excellent piece but it has so many things that your are not going to use at all :). I hope you enjoy this as I'm doing now with mine.","Excellent  piece, excellent view, and nice night light  :)",B0002M9STU

They have a nice sole that doesn't make a loud clicking noise when you walk, and it seems like they'll be able to handle the snow and ice well (they're waterproof, although I wouldn't really test that by deliberately walking through puddles). The zippers (there are two on each boot, only one that you actually use to get them on and off) make a bit of a clinking noise, but I would say that boots usually aren't super quiet when you walk. Another thing to note is that in addition to the calves being narrow on these, the boots themselves are pretty tall.

I ordered 1/2 a size up since I have somewhat wide feet, and they fit fine.  They're pretty true-to-size, perhaps a little small.  I'd suggest ordering your size or 1/2 a size up, depending on your foot width, but don't order small.

Best I could of purchased.  I'm a size 8 and purchased that perfect fit.  These are great shoes for practice.

Moderately priced practice shoe with thin soles without padding that make them very flexible. Be aware that the strap across the instep is not adjustable.

"Very happy with these dance shoes.  I have side feet through the instep but they are average otherwise.  It's been extremely difficult to find dance shoes that I can wear comfortably for the 4 hours I spend dancing in one night.  These did the trick.  Not a lot of arch support, but they aren't made for that with the split sole.  Comfort is main benefit.

"Although Amazon didn't have my size, I found this shoe at a local dance store and I'm so glad I did!

I was originally hesitant to buy an open-toe shoe for fear of my toes slipping forward, but these are great dance shoes. They allow for a sexy open-toe look, but the T-strap holds the shoe up and, with the higher sides, doesn't allow for your toes to slide forward and out of the shoe. The highest point of the toe opening is around 1.5 inches, and allowed half of my big toe to show (descending, of course, from there on down to my last two toes, which can't be seen at all). The heel is a perfect height for me, just shy of 2.75 inches. The color is a flat black, no shine or bling. But I'm planning on making a few removable fabric ""sleeves"" for the t-strap, one with rhinestones, one with pearls, etc. The only other thing I added was that I cut a piece of moleskin padding (with the adhesive backing) and put it in the shoe on the edge of the toe opening, in the curve next to my big toe. I believe that effectively stopped the shoe from cutting into my toe and provided a little more help in holding back my foot. I've worn them ballroom dancing for 2 times now, 3 hours each time and no problems. In street shoes I wear a 9, these are a 9.5. I have another pair of Capezios from Amazon (you can read my review&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capezio-Women-s-Capezio-Dancesport-Mariana-Dance-Shoe/dp/B006LXO970/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capezio Women's Capezio Dancesport Mariana Dance Shoe</a>).

"I'm actually a non-dancer and have been looking everywhere for retro t-strap heels for a reasonable price. I found these shoes on another site and hunted around for the best price. Not only were they cheap on Amazon, but when I got them and tried them on, they were cute, sexy, light, and totally comfortable. I could see myself presenting at a day long meeting or out on the town walking all night in these. The only reason these didn't get 5 stars is that they seemed a little cheaply made for the price they go on most sites.

"I love my watch.  Since my eyes are not as good as they used to be, I wanted a dial and background that were easy to read as well as an expandable band and did not need to be wound.  This watch is perfect and is the only one I wear.  The gold numbers on the black background make it much easier to read.  If you are looking for something that really looks good and works great, I would suggest you look at this product.",Timex Wrist Watch,B0002V2VGI
This was just the watch I was looking for. I previously had one just like it except with a white face. Wanted to try the black face and am very pleased with it. The expansion band is just the right size and did not need any adjustment. Thank you for a great watch at a great price.,PERFECT!!,B0002V2VGI
"Although Timex says this watch is water resistant to 30 meters, it has been my experience that the slightest exertion at the clinical lab where I work causes the crystal of this watch to steam up so badly that the time can not be read at all.  Simply the warmth of my wrist, not sweat from heavy exercise, renders this watch useless.  I have never encountered this before and am at a loss as to what to do because I have never gotten the watch wet or even damp. I could understand if there was even a small amount of perspiration involved, but there is not.  This is simply normal body heat under average work conditions where little exertion is required.  I am very disappointed and pretty lost as I expect any other watch of equal rating would have the same problem.  I haven't bought a work watch in 15 years or so and can't understand if this problem is new and the quality of Timex watches has deteriorated or what.  It seems that the quality is not what it once was.

UPDATE:  We returned this watch to Amazon and were stunned by how easy the process is to complete, costing us nothing and very little inconvenience, as well as how quickly we were refunded the purchase prices.  Customer service like this is a SHOCK in today's world of lazy, greedy, corporate monoliths staffed by idiots.  Amazon not only offers the best prices in most cases, but it is superior in almost every way, including Free Shipping, No Taxes, let me repeat, No Taxes! (where I live it's 10% and outright robbery!), excellent customer service, staggering selection, and ease of use.  Also, we repurchased the same Timex as there was a flaw in the first one.  It works perfectly, looks good for a work watch, and was incredibly inexpensive here on Amazon with Low Price, Free Shipping, NO TAXES!, and fast first-class service.  Thanks, Amazon!",Crystal Steams Up and Time Can't Be Seen - Replaced,B0002V2VGI

"I looked high and low for this style of watch because a family member had a similar one back in the 1940s when I was a child. I like the shape and the 30s retro appearence. I wanted a watch with a battery for the convenience and this watch fits the bill. I have had many compliments on the style. The one complaint I have is that the watch band is shorter than I would like. Increasing the length by a centimeter or two wouldn't cost too much for the maker and then I would have been 100% satisfied.

"A very good value watch for the money. A very easy to read dial that glows brightly when going from a lighted area into a darkened area.  Recessed crown, 36mm case diameter and stainless steel band make watch very comfortable to wear, even for small or medium sized wrists.  Automatic movement is reasonably accurate, loses about 5 minutes each month. Just advance time by 5 minutes on the first of each month.

"I have had this for about a month. It keeps good time, and the power reserve is at least 36 hours. This is only a water-resistant piece, so I haven't been exposing it to water except for handwashing and rain.

When I bought this I purchased a 18mm leather band for it, but this was actually too small. I returned it and bought a 19mm band instead (deBeer sport leather) which is a better fit. The brown goes well with the blue dial.

I really like the simple face and it's a nice point of interest to show off the transparent back. I have scratched the face a lil' bit, but when viewed straight on the scratch isn't noticeable. It is only a hardex glass, not sapphire.

What you see is what you get, really. A nice little (I have skinny wrists so this was a key feature for me) watch that looks good and keeps good time. There are no fancy features and when I got mine it only came in a basic blue box (with a little cushion for displaying though) with generic Seiko instructions (this was from MrWatch.com). It's not hard to figure out though, the date/day is set at the 1st crown position and the time set 2nd crown position.","Tidy little watch, note band size",B0002XQW66

"As noted in the description, the colors you receive may vary.  I received white, black and sage colored head bands.

While I think these bands are cute, I'm sensitive to excessive pressure around my head.  If you are migraine/headache sufferer, these bands may not be your thing.  My bands averaged about 15 1/4 inches long by 2 5/16 inches wide.  The material stretches slightly but not much.  Evaluate how much pressure you like around your head by measuring a band that you already own and you really like the feel of then compare the dimensions to what I provided.

I was also expecting wider bands as the description calls them thermal wraps.  I thought the thermal wraps would protect my ears.  They are of a pretty typical width and will not be protecting much of your head from the elements.

I ordered a size 7 and the arch fits perfect for both my feet.  My left foot is 1/2 a size smaller then my right, so the fact that the arch is perfect for both is amazing.

"This watch looks beautiful and it is quiet and precise. Also, it is pretty thin and comfortable. It would be perfect if there were no two issues:

1. It stopped working after two weeks. I suspected battery, so had a little trouble opening the watch.

This is what you need to do: Find small opening between the lid and the body of the watch. Use very sharp knife or small flat screwdriver (that you can use to tighten sunglasses) and open. If you do not find this small hole, there is no way to open it. BTW, battery is hard to find in electronic or pharmacy stores. After I replaced it, it works just fine. The original battery was Sony, but it is possible that the watch was in a warehouse in the box for a year or two before it was shipped to me.

2. Another concern is the knob on the side that is a little long and may rub the skin on your hand.

I recommend this watch.",Nice watch,B0002Z3Y3I

"I replaced a 16 year old Wenger watch (same model) with this one. It had been completely reliable until the knob for manually changing time went off alignment and wouldn't work anymore

Note: the size of the watch is substantial.  My old one was the ladies' version which was nearly as large as a regular dress watch for men. This one is the men's size... it's quite large, which makes reading time (especially at night) much easier for my now bifocal-using eyes :)

The phosphorescent dots on the dial 'charge up' in a couple of minutes and last a long time in the dark.

the only drawback on this watch design is the date number counter:  you have to manually set it every other month.

Tip: you can change the battery yourself and save $$$ (note: if you have the battery changed at a dept store, for 9-15$, the warranty will be voided just the same as if you do it yourself). The back cover has to be unscrewed (i use needle-nose pliers with a rubber griper as a scratch-preventing liner) and voil!)","Simple, rugged, easy-read",B00030O3SM
"This particular Wenger has a serious problem with reading the dial.  With the stainless steel color on the face from the various small dials and the fact the hour and minute hands have very small amount of ""glow"" you will have great difficulty reading the time.  I have had Wenger watches for years - the mechanics as usual are great the durability is great the ability to ""tell the time"" is lacking.  This need a redesign of the face.

It's not the easiest watch to read at first glance, but the hands blend in and make for a very clean overall face appearance. The blue is understated and a classy touch. Oddly, the crown is not locking but the thing is rated to 50 meters. Should be fine for a pool and wet environs. The watch has a ton of functions. More than I can get into.

I got these specifically for the tread.  I live just south of where snow and ice is normal.  Last year was pretty rough and there isn't the gear to deal with it here so parking lots and sidewalks are generally packed slick ice if we get snow.  It can take a week or more to clear.

I don't expect to slog through 24inch drifts in these (too short) but they have room for extra thick socks (why I listed somewhat wide) yet they work well at the size listed.  I got a size 7 and range based on brand/make from 6.5-7.5 (usually a 7 USA ladies).",Good for Ice and Snow,B0005CHNJY

If you are in pinch for suit and just need something for your child to wear until you can get another bathing suit then you should purchase this one.  Otherwise, you would be better off buying a more expensive Speedo bathing suit (which I have) that still fits great (as Speedo suits usually do) because the more expensive bathing suits resist fading and pilling and they really do last.","Cute suit, but didn't wear well",B0007QMAM8

"This is a unique watch that can be set to alarm, for example, every hour, reminding your toddler to go to the bathroom.  I have children with special needs who were very difficult to train.  They would fail to go to the bathroom enough which eventually caused their bladder to work less well and to hold less volume.  The doctor's prescription was to have them go to the bathroom once per hour.  Asking a classroom teacher to make sure this happened in the midst of all the other students was a lot, and to make sure my child remembered was asking more than I could ask.  This was THE answer.

Well, for starters, it has a stretchable band. This makes it very easy for a 5-year-old to take the watch on and off. It is also more comfortable than Velcro (TM) type.

The watch is a little over sized for a 5-year-old, but mine does not mind that, at all. It has a lot of functions for a kid's watch: stop watch, timer, alarm and date. My kid already learns how to use the stop watch and the date function. The timer takes a little more work, as the amount of time needs to be specified first.

"I had bought these boots in anticipation of my children being able to wear them within the next few winter seasons. The price at the time was less than 20 dollars, which meant that I had to buy while the sale price was available.

Not ever owning Columbia Boots myself, I was pleasantly surprised to find that these boots are extremely well-made. The uppers appear to be made with quality materials and manufacturing. The opening of the boot can be opened very wide - important for children being able to easily get their feet in and out of the boots (or for me when I am helping them).

The soles have a nice deep gripper surface.

"My children absolutely love their new watches but I was extremely disappointed to find the watches in the condition in which they were when they arrived. I purchased both watches ""new"" just in time for my children's birthdays. The 1st watch had so much hot glue to hold the arm on that I couldn't dig it out and was completely missing the pin to keep the arm attached. The second watch also had a ton of glue but in this case it was supporting the pin. Unfortunately I didn't have time to return either watch but instead rook them to my jeweler who only charged me $5 to repair both watches. Needless to say I was highly disappointed!

"Here is my take on this. It isn't too expensive so it isn't going to be super awesome. However, I DID expect it to work. It came to me with no display. I assumed I needed to turn it on somehow. Nope. Batteries included? Yep. Not working. I tried to call the number on the package. Disconnected. Website? Dead. Ok so the reason amazon only has 3 left in stock is because these are probably old ass watches and the company went out of business. I'll return the watch. I am bummed because I really wanted it to work. If they can replace it with one that actually works right I'll be happier. I DO however think it's lame that I have to pay to send it back. Not my fault that it's broken. I can't speak to the quality of the product because I don't know. Right now I just have a pink bracelet. It is a little heavy, but not too big like the Brickhouse watch. I bought the AmberAlert GPS 3G as well. I liked this because it was always with my kid, she couldn't just drop it by accident. If you want to try it, know that if you open it, you can't get a refund unless it's broken. You also have to pay a restocking fee of 15%. And the company is most likely gone. I would keep looking. Check out the Amberalert 3g gps system. It's much more money but if you are looking for something serious it is where it is at.",Meh,B000AEZS26

"Bought this watch for my wife, who is a huge Harry Potter Fan.  Thought that she might have seen it before, but turns out that this was the first time she had ever seen it.

The watch comes in a Harry Potter Goblet of Fire tin case that can be later used as a small coin bank.  The watch appears well made all the way around, keeps time correctly, and the emblem cover appears to be made of some sturdy material that has a very positive snap when it closes.

Spoke to several other Harry Potter fans and none of them have seen this watch, appears to be a real winner.  This is turning out to be a must have, especially for its clearance price.

Hope this helps",Great present for the Harry Potter Fan,B000AXUQJW
"There are many reasons to collect HP watches.  In my case, I wanted to have a watch that would be a sort of souvenir for each Harry Potter movie released.  And what better souvenir watch for the fourth movie installment than one having the image of the three friends and the Goblet on its dial!

The Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Flip Top Watch by SII Marketing International measures 1.25"" in diameter.  This collectible wristwatch was first issued in 2005 and at that time I thought it was a large one.  Now that I have seen the GOF models for this year, I think this flip top watch is sized just right.  The brushed brass tone flip top features an ornate shield with the HP logo at its center.  Two small ruby-like stones (they're probably glass) adorn the top and bottom center of the shield.  The flip top opens to a 90-degree angle to reveal Harry, Ron, Hermione and the Goblet of Fire against a silver patterned background.  The brass case is nicely complemented by a dark brown crocodile style leather band with enough punch holes to fit small wrists.  The words ""Harry Potter"" are engraved on the buckle.

I had a hard time rating this watch because my judgment is based on both the functionality and the aesthetics of the piece.  This watch definitely deserves 4 stars in the looks department but somewhat less when it comes to practicality.  You have to hold the flip top open.  The shiny dot markers are easily seen but the delicate sword-styled hands and sweep seconds hand were designed to blend with the characters' black cloaks and uniforms which makes telling time on this watch a bit hard to do.

Still, this timepiece is a worthy addition to any Harry Potter watch collection.  It's beautiful and it's great for displaying.  And wear it if you like.  You may not be able to tell the time at a glance but the flip top of this watch makes for a cool way to let the world know you're an HP fan.",Beautiful watch to celebrate a great movie,B000AXUQJW

"My baby girl has beat this thing half to death for over a year now, and it is still ticking away like a Timex is known to do. It also has the numbers for the minutes written on the face (very small, but no problem for my children's eyes) making it a great watch to teach your kids how to tell time. That is exactly what we did with this piece, and she was almost the only kid in her 2nd Grade class that could tell time on a proper watch with hands, let alone use it to read a map and find true North. She was the envy of all of her friends. In my opinion, teaching them on a useful watch along with how to find north and use it on a map was much more engaging, fun, and all around informative for my kids.

She is now in 4th grade, and still uses this watch all the time. It is quite dirty looking now, but works perfectly and is still easy to read as the day she got it. I will probably replace it with the same one with a different band soon. If anyone ever mentions which way we're going, she always checks her watch against the sun to tell them... Even though she's done it so much now she pretty much ALWAYS know EXACTLY where North is! LOL. Great buy.","Still ticking after a year, great buy",B000AYW0IG
"My 8 year old had the basics of telling time down but was not confident at all. With the minutes listed by fives above the 1, 2, 3 ect. she has become proficient and confident at telling time right down the the minute.  She looks at clocks everywhere now and proudly tells everyone the time.  The watch has a soft band with velcro so it will fit any size arm. It was a bit stiff the first couple of days since my daughter's wrist was smaller than where the bend was originally formed by the velcro but it loosened up quickly.  It also lights up to the delight of young children.  Definitely the best ""first"" watch I have purchased and I have bought many others.",Great Watch!,B000AYW0IG
"I can't speak on durability as of yet since we have only had it a month, but it is very cute and the indiglo in the shape of a flower is absolutley delightful to my 4 yo- it just fits her wrist and hopefully it lasts long enough for her to grow into it for a while",Cute watch for toddler who loves purple,B000AYW0IG

"I bought this for my 4yo son.  The fit is great and the material is great.  He has no difficulty zipping it.  The only thing I don't like about the fleece is minor and I knew when I purchased it - It doesn't have a hood.  We've already had days that the AM Bus Stop temperature was 30 degrees, so a hood would have been great.  The days warm up to mid 50s to 60s, so by recess he really doesn't need a hood.  I did find another fleece with a hood, and have that on it's way from Amazon.com.","Fabulous, but could be even better with a hood!",B000B7MGJU
"I hate giving bad reviews, but I feel it's worse to not tell buyers before they purchase about a potential problem. I have many Columbia brand jackets, clothes, etc. so I thought I'd be safe buying this for my son as a fall jacket. I was very disappointed when it came and I discovered was very short (above the waist) and very wide at the bottom (stuck out several inches to let plenty of cold air in). Really a poor fit. Typically clothes run true to size for him, so I was confused by the terrible cut of this jacket.

Not recommended.",Short and Wide,B000B7MGJU
"Got this for my son for Christmas and it immediately became his go-to jacket (by his own choosing).  Now no matter what the weather, no matter what the temperature, he wants to wear this fleece - and he's always bummed when we make him wear his heavier coat when it's too cold and/or windy for a fleece.  And this from a boy that generally doesn't give a hoot about what he wears!  He loves the soft wear of the fleece and it looks really handsome & masculine on him.  The full-length zipper and raised collar make this more useful and easier to get on and off than a 1/4 zip fleece.  It's a mid-weight fleece providing good warmth for its weight and it seems well-constructed and has been trouble free after a month and a half of nearly daily use.  My son (7) is a little bit big for his age and we got him the 10/12, it's kind of big on him but still functional & with room to grow - he'll definitely get at least a couple of seasons out of it.  We paid $20 for it at a local department store, and it has proven to be a super purchase.  Sturdy, understated but stylish, really comfy, and most importantly he loves it.

"I got this for my birthday and a little over a year later it was useless.  The plastic/rubber watch strap just corroded away and broke off.  I went to the Nike Store to get a new strap and they said try a sporting goods store.  Went to a couple and couldn't find any place that sold replacement straps.  I searched the internet high and low and eventually found Parsec Ent.  They sent me a strap for $23.95 (rip off) only to find out that it is impossible to replace the strap.  A good Nike watch going in the trash, bummer.","If you want it for longevity, don't buy it.",B000E8H0HY
"Previously, I owned an Oregon Scientific heart rate monitor, which worked great for 5 years.  It had basic features which I found useful but needed to replace it because it wasn't as accurate/consistent as it use to be.

I was not sure about buying the Nike Imara Heart Rate Monitor because there weren't any reviews on it.  But I liked the design and color choices and I knew it was designed specifically for women by Nike (a reputable company). Now that I have the product and have used it for 1 week, I feel satisfied with my purchase.  The price was great and I received it quickly from Amazon. The Nike Imara Heart Rate Monitor is pretty, and easy to use.  There are 5 modes: Time, Chronograph, Interval, Data, and Alarm.  It comes with an instruction manual and CD to program the modes.  Both are easy to follow when programming your monitor but the CD adds a nice visual experience for those women that need a demonstration.  The watch band is a nice thick plastic.  It's a little difficult to put on at first but you quickly get use to it.

First and most important, I find that Nike Imara Heart Rate Monitor is accurate when measuring my bpm. I use the chronograph (CHRO) mode which gives your bpm or average bpm and a stop watch.  The rate does not jump around with random, unrealistic heart rate readings.  I chose to wear the chest strap without the elastic strap by placing it inside my sports bra.  I get a nice consistent reading of my heart rate even when I'm jumping around. The out of range alarms are a nice feature that alert you when to work harder or slow down.  You hear a stead single beep when your heart rate is below target and a double beep when it is above target.  I also like the fact that the chest strap transmits my bpm to my exercise machine that has a heart rate monitor on it.

I have not tried the interval training (INTR) mode so I can't comment about it accuracy.  But I'm sure it would be useful for those women that like to exercise at different intensities during their workout and need to know when to change the intensity or be alerted when they are outside of the intensity range.

The DATA mode gives you a summary of your workout accomplishments.  However, you only get this summary if you remember to press the start button during your CHRO or INTR mode.  The summary for your workout includes your total workout time, average bpm, total calorie burned, total time in your target heart rate zone (if you programmed a zone), total time above your target HR zone, and total time below your HR zone.

I think this is a great basic HR monitor.  It's perfect for women in all exercise ranges (weight loss, strength training, etc.) because of the interval training feature.  I also think it's perfect of pregnant women that want to exercise during their pregnancy and keep track of their HR to make sure they are not over exercising.

I may add to or modify this review after using it for a longer period of time.  I hope this was helpful and I hope others write reviews on this HR watch when they purchase it.",Great heart rate monitor,B000E8H0HY

I have a 2 and 4 year old and I was hoping to have something that I could press a button if I didn't see them and the watch would beep.

This is not easy for kids that age to accomplish, plus, it is basically useless if someone grabs them.  This might be a great tool for older children if they get lost somewhere, but it is not effective at all for young children.

This is the second time I buy these exact shoes for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She outgrew her last pair and I had to have them again.  They are sturdy and so easy to put on and take off. She can even do it herself.  They are also easy to clean.,I love Keds!,B000EIZ6QG
"This is one great little shoe.  This is about the fourth pair I have gotten for my little girl.  It is well made.  It holds up well in washings.  (I do wash them a lot due to this S.

You definitely, get your money's worth out of this brand.",Toddler Leather Keds A+,B000EIZ6QG
"I love the look of the Keds Mary Jane shoe, however it seems to run a bit narrow.  My little girls foot is absolutely average in width and I find that the velcro closure doesn't really meet up very well when I'm trying to latch the shoe closed. It seems to be a bit short. If the strap had a little bit longer strap I would be able to say I love this shoe.  It appears to be well made and it looks great with all of the little dresses she wears on a daily basis. I hope with time the velcro that is left exposed doesn't pick up fuzz and filth making that part of the shoe appear gross.  Only time will tell.  The leather is easy to keep clean and she can put them on all by herself which is great for my little independent woman.",keds mary jane almost great,B000EIZ6QG

Bought this Shoes in March 2014. It was the worst buy ever. After 1 week it looked like something that was dropped in sulphuric acid. The scuffing was a UNBELIEVABLE. The color changed was miraculous. The threadings were everywhere. The shoes just fell apart. I won't buy this product again. It doesn't deserve a single star. The idea of the shoe is okay ie the design shape color...but the material is of the lowest quality ever. Good idea.....Bad execution.  Look but don't touch!!!,Look but don't touch!!!!,B0009BF8SY

"I purchased 3 for dance costumes.  They are a little too peach colored, it's listed as theatrical pink and they are peach.  But, the material has a nice feel.  As said in a previous comment, there is no lining but, I've grown up dancing and 75% of my leotards had no linings.  Good for the price, shipping was fast... I will have to try to dye them though.  This leotard would be perfect for a beginner ballet class.",nice for the price,B000ENN12W

"This is our second Danskin leotard and I'm a bit disappointed.  We learned with the first one that they RUN SMALL!  My daughter is a very average 4 yr old and she wears every inch of the 4-6 size, so this time we got the 6x-7/Intermediate size and while it fits her well (definite room to grow), the fabric is not nearly as nice as the first one we had.  The fabric is smooth and stretchy and has an overall nice feel to it, but it's just not as nice of quality as the other one we have.  Additionally there is NO LINER in this leo at all, not even in the crotch.  For 10 bucks I'm not going to bother returning it, it will suffice, but next time I will consider a different brand.",very different from last Danskin leo,B000ENN12W

I have gotten tights from everywhere. I bought some from Target recently too. None compare to Bloch. Bloch tights can handle a lot of wear. They will stain before they wear out. The only reason I buy new ones is because my daughter does stain them by playing on the floors too much at the dance studio. Otherwise they stay in great condition and they wash like new. These tights are excellent quality. They are true to size and they hug the legs the way tights should. Tights should not have baggy areas. Since my girl started dancing I have become somewhat of a fan of Bloch apparel. They are the only brand of ballet slippers I buy.,Bloch forever,B000ENN3SO

"This product is really great -- my brother and I wore them when we were kids. They are still well-made, classically cute, and easy to put on and take off a just-learning-to-walk toddler. The only reason it's not a 5-star item is the sturdy rubber sole is a bit heavy, and our 14 month-old twins first walked around like they had blocks of cement on their feet. But that said, these are great for around the house and outdoors, flexible in the right places and a total bargain.

They can take alot of wear and tear, and seem to be really comfortable to my son.

A lot of socks get wet easily, make your feet sweat, are too warm, too cold, too thick, too thin...not the case with Smartwool.

These particular socks in an XS fit my toddler's size 8-9 feet perfectly. I think he could wear them again next year as they do stretch a bit. The color is a very attractive taupe and they are really soft. He's worn these all winter and has not once complained.

"Admittedly, this shoe was bought for my boys because Amazon had it on a great sale. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Stride Rite has done it again - a sturdily-made yet ""fad"" enough looking shoe to withstand what a little boy can dish out.
The H & L connectors are strong and eliminate the messy look of shoelaces yet at this age. The insides of the shoe are padded. The soles are thick and the outer front of the shoe is protected by a rubber toe guard.
These shoes have gone just about everywhere on my boy's feet and there have been no complaints or problems.",Great little shoe for boys,B000FIJTYA

I am very pleased with the Stride Rite white/navy sneaker and I could get it in wide which was much easier than going shopping with an 18 month old. It shipped quickly and arrived in a few days in perfect condition at an unmatched price. The shoe is exactly what is described on-line and was in perfect condition. I will definitely order shoes on-line again for him.,Toddler Boys' Stride Rite shoe,B000FIJTYA
"The item as ordered meets my expectations as Stride Rite has good quality items for the young growing child.  The sneaker fit was exact to size, my child is a 13 1/2 however you require a little rom for growing feet, i purchased the 1.

I recently purchased a pair of stride rite girls' Ashley Tennis shoes for my daughter. The shoes are of great quality and the style is cool. They fit well and are quite comfortable.

She is doing great in the shoes and is starting to even cruise across the furniture!!  Also, the shoes have stayed on better than any shoe I have bought for her to date. Every other pair of shoes I have bought for her doesn't fit her foot or they end up in her mouth because she pulls them off.",Great shoes for your infant!!,B000FIJRZG
"I don't know if I'm simply happy to be able to now find shoes that my baby can fit, or whether the Katy Stage 3 is just adorable.  I love Stride Rite shoes, but I also love the fact that Amazon now carries them.  I knew my baby's foot had grown, so I ordered exactly what I wanted from Amazon.  Plus, the shoes were between three and five dollars cheaper than Stride Rite.  Finally, I didn't have to wait for Stride Rite to ship them because Amazon was the shipper & seller.  Some companies take too long to ship, so thank God Amazon ships for Stride Rite.

This is so much better than taking a number in Stride Rite lol.",Lovely girl's shoe,B000FIJRZG
"My two year old has a very wide foot with a high instep.  So far this is the only style shoe that comes in a double wide for her little fat feet.  They wear very well, there is pratically no weight to the shoe, so they are great for pre-walkers. The style is so cute, that I have one pair in all three colors.  They wear casual and dressed up.  I don't know what I will do once she grows out of the largest size for this shoe. Hopefully, her foot will thin out by then.  Great shoe though.",I Love this Shoe!,B000FIJRZG

I am a StrideRite fan and this shoe did not fail me.  These shoes are not stiff and has good traction.  She can walk for long periods of time without the shoes hurting her feet.  The best part is that she can fasten the shoes herself.,Fantastic dress shoe!,B000FIJW7O

"I purchased these in a size 5 for my daughter because a) they were less than some of the other stride rite shoes and b) they were adorable.  Well, these were just unwearable and I even had them fitted and checked in the stride rite store.  The velcro was always coming undone, the shoes always falling off plus they were very stiff so she had difficulty walking in them.  In the end, we always had to take the shoes off for her to run around in until I finally conceded and bought a pair of the $42 katy (I belive) shoes which  are what you would expect from a stride rite shoe.",Not a good buy!,B000FIJW7O

"My son LOVES these shoes and it is hard to get him to wear anything else.  The firetruck itself is a big hit, but the flashing lights make them even more special.

As an added bonus, those flashing lights make it easy to locate him after dusk - which comes around 4:30 pm in these parts.  We took him to several holiday lighted displays, and we always knew exactly where he was, even when he tried to push ahead to get a better look.

I love the Stride Rite product for my toddler grandson.  Comfort and support are not sacrificed for style.  The fit is great for a toddler with a thick foot and these are by far the most stylish and versatile sandals of the many that I looked at for my grandson.  I have since purchased many Stride Rite products for him and they have not only supported his feet properly but have been durable enough to take what a 2 year old can dish out.  They held up so well that we were able to pass them down to his baby brother.  I definitely got my money's worth from these sandals.,Stride Rite and Toddlers go together,B000FINGKS

"I just received these for my granddaughter.  They are ADORABLE and appear to be well-made, with 'real' leather.  The only reservation I have about them is the buckle.  They seem really stiff and it could be frustrating for a toddler wait while you buckle them for her.  I am hopeful that they will 'loosen' up a bit and become easier with time.

I wanted to update this review.  I am returning these sandals because they have an odd fit. They are way short in the front, and too long in the back.  This is the first pair of Stride Rite's that we've come across that are like this.","Buckles, Not Velcro",B000FINNH4

When she was younger, the sandals went well with all those girly-dresses. Now, they still go well with her jeans and mini-skirts. (My daughter is VERY style conscious.)

I bought these sandals for my 7 year old son. He LOVES them. I love them because these sandals protect his little toes. My son wore these sandals on vacation and not once did he complain that his feet hurt! I will def be getting a couple more pair for the coming years!!,Great Sandals,B000FISGZS
"I bought these shoes after going to the stride rite website and printing off the shoe size chart (just to make sure I was getting the right size for my son in case his feet had changed - they hadn't.).  When they arrived, just by looking at them, I could tell they weren't going to work.  They didn't even come close to the width or length of our other stride rite shoes in the same size and width.  Don't know if I got a funky pair, or if they just screwed these shoes up bad, but I'm trying a different model and hoping that I can still find sandles for my son that are wide enough.",Not really XW,B000FISGZS

"Stride Rite's are good shoes and these are priced so low.  I don't know why and I won't ask.  When I got them, they were nice (looked just like the picture) with a square toe.  The size is right on, they are cushy inside, and the bottom is not slippery.  My toddler likes wearing them even when he does not have too.",Excellent price and excelllent shoe!,B000FITIKU

"Stride-Rite makes a nice solid shoe, but they tend to be pricey. But, because my son has a wide foot and these sneaks come in wide width and fit very nicely, I pay the price. Amazon has much better prices than the Stride Rite stores, here.

He loves the lights on soles of the shoe. We did have a problem with a previous pair of these shoes when the lights stopped working. But, that was due to the fact that I machine washed (and dried) them which made the light sensor short out.",Great quality shoe,B000FIQJ0C

"My son has Fred Flintstone feet.  Stride Rites are the only shoes we buy and love getting good deals on them at amazon.  These are good shoes, stylish and durable.  I love that they have a scuff-proof surface on the toe, I've made the mistake of buying the all white leather ones which I loved the look of for about a day until they were hopelessly scuffed up. Also these go with more outfits then you might think BUT buy new flat laces or you will be tying them constantly.  Really, CONSTANTLY!!  I've found all Stride-Rite shoeslaces to be this way.

"My 5 y.o. son had outgrown his last sandals. These were available at the right size and a good price. They are PERFECT. They're comfortable and look GREAT. They're also very sturdy as my son (being a typical boy) has been tramping around in them all summer and they're still looking good.

Definitely recommend them!

The bonus is they look like a pair that his Dad has, so he loves wearing his sandals ""like Daddy's""",My son LOVES it!,B000FITRW4
Ladies I wear a size 8 wide.  And I was looking for a hiking sandal for sometime at a reasonable price.  I saw Amazon listed the size as well as the length of the shoe and got out my ruler.  A size five wide shoe was cutting it close I knew that it might not fit but at the Friday Deal price I couldn't resist.  Fast shipping straight to my door.  Out the box and on my feet!  They just barely fit with maybe less than a 1/4inch at the toes. I was concerned I didn't want anything that would cause me to stub my toes on hikes. So I did a stub test and found my foot was still protected.  COOL! This a keeper. The rugged sole will handle any terrain. (I don't know if they're water proof) and the suede like insole is comfortable. The back strap is padded (No blisters!) and the front straps easy to adjust. Cute enought to for walking through the concrete  streets of NYC and rugged enough for Hikes along the Hudson. Should have bought two pair cause these sandals are gonna get a work out.,At Last a sandal I adore,B000FITRW4
great style.surprised the wide wasn't that wide...........but still adjustable and fit.,great basic sandal for boys,B000FITRW4
"bought this shoes which is just the right size for my boy. Even if it has enough allowance/space for his toes, its difficult to wear them. I was only trying it on him, and yet i have to remove the entire shoe lace. Very troublesome. Thus, i have to return it. I love stride rite specially their looks and the different sizes/stages to comfortably fit those precious feet, but this model didn't work for my boy.","difficult to wear, need to remove the lace",B000FIQ8ZS

"I absolutely love these shoes.  My son was just about to walk but needed that little extra stability.  He took his first steps the very day the shoes arrived and has been running around in them ever since.  Here we are 3 months later and they're still holding up beautifully.  If you're considering these shoes, just go for it.  They're well worth the money!",Baccio Stage 3 Lace Up,B000FIQ8ZS

"Stride Rite are know for quality shoes and this pair is no exception. My son loves his new pair of shoes. They are comfortable and long lasting. His other pair of Stride-Rite are still good enough to be passed down to his younger brother, that's how good these shoes are for quality. The price is also good, you won't find them any cheaper anywhere else so buy them Rite here.",My son loves these shoes,B000FITHV0
"I recently purchased this for my son, who is still mostly crawling, but taking his first steps.  Initially I purchased a Medium width because I don't think he has particularly chubby feet.  Those did not work - they were hard to put on and not comfortable in his ankles.  I changed them for the Wide and they work great!  We have received a lot of compliments on them!  My son hates shoes, hats, bibs... even clothes... but these pair he likes and does not complain about... so they must be comfortable for him.  The other plus is that, because of the long strap, these are not so easy for them to take off like other sandals that just have velcro at the tip of the strap.  He isnot outgrowing these and I think I will get him another pair fo the same because the summer has not even started yet!",Super cute and comfortable!!,B000FIVN4E
"Despite the velcro strap, these are difficult to put on because of the shallow opening at the front of the shoe. Maybe it would fit a very skinny foot.",Difficult to put on,B000FIVN4E
Good fit but leather is very hard. My son had several shoe bites and no longer wears the shoe.,good fit,B000FIVN5S
We purchased these shoes at the start of the summer. They are very well made and adorable on. The flexible sole and closed toe box made them a summer favorite for climbing and playing. He has almost out grown them and they still look super. I hope we can find them next year.,Adorable and durable,B000FIVN5S
"So the shoes are absolutely adorable, very comfortable and look great. But maybe I just don't know how to tie those shoe laces or something. They are a pain. I thought that since we don't wear dress shoes every day, it wouldn't be bad to have shoes with laces (most of our others are with velcro), but these are particularly a hassle...unfortunately.",Don't like the laces,B000FIVNP8

I bought these saddle shoes for my 20 month old she loves them! The quality construction is nothing less than I expected from Stride Rite.

"I bought a pair of these exact shoes for my 9 y.o. son 2 yrs ago at Nordstroms for $65.00.

I was buying my self a pair of shoes and looked a kids section and saw his beloved shoes...........the same ones I paid $65.00 for, for only $17.00!

"I ordered these on a Thursday night and they arrived on Monday. They look really good on my son.  He wore a 4 which was getting too small. I orderd a 5.5  and it fits a bit big but not much. I would say they are cut a bit on the small side but then again the tongue setup could have an effect on the sneaker too. At any rate, they look great, fit great, and the price was outstanding with Prime and the free shipping. I ordered another pair a bit bigger.

I was very pleased with the quality of this shoe. The uppers are sturdy and the colors look great on a little boy's feet. The shoes look great with denim, corduroy and even khakis.
One of my sons has a wide foot and I was pleasantly surprised to find that even the regular width was comfortable for him to wear. There are two very strong H&L straps across the top of the foot which hold this shoe securely. The straps are adjustable enough to allow for the shoe to be held open very wide in order to insert a child's foot.

The little velcro strap at the side of the shoe doesn't allow for the tongue to come completely out so sometimes it's a hassle. Although, my son has chubby feet for a thin kid, so maybe it's just him. I have to push his heel down and this usually causes him to giggle since it's ticklish. Either way, I would recommend them.",Great Product,B000H883UY

"What parent doesn't like Stride Rite's quality shoes at a good price?

The Landon lace up is well made, with high quality leather and stitching throughout. The sole of the shoe is a semi-flexible rubberish material.

I like the Landon particularly because the sole is much more flexible than
the suede dress shoes Stride Rite makes.

I also think that Landon's leather look can be worn throughout the year, versus only winters for suede. (IMO)

There is minimal padding in the shoe, which may or may not make a difference to you.

With Amazon's sales/discounts, I ordered several sizes/colors at about $15 a pair.

My husband hates my ""stocking up"" but he'll be thanking me later that we won't be scouting for dress shoes at the last minute! Plus - these will easily re-sell at the consignment store. :-)",Great dress shoe for the little man in your life :-),B000H882BO

They offer great support in the soles and the uppers. The velcro attachments are strong and wide enough to provide good closure to the shoe.

My only suggestion would be to change the buttons to snaps.  That way she could do it herself.  The buttons are a tight fit for the holes.  Overall, an excellent purchase!",Very Cute!,B000I2RLBQ

"My three year old grandson has almost every item made from the movie CARS.

When I saw these sneakers, I just had to get them for him. He lives in Rhode Island, and I live in Delaware. It was so cold that his southern mommy would not leave the house to go to the mailstation to pick up the package. Finally, his dad picked them up on the way home from class. He called and said,""Ganny!!! thank you for Lightening McQueen shoes. I love them""  I know all the characters since he has most of the toys. He wanted to wear them with his CARS pajamas to bed. They appeared to be of good quality for a rough and tumble three year old. Thank you for helping make Jack's Valentine'sDay even more special.",How to win your grandson's heart,B000I2XAUM

"My son is crazy about cars and as he tends to run rather than walk these days, I really wanted to get him some light up shoes -I've looked around and these are the best light up shoes.  When he walks the lights flash in sequence in various parts of the shoe, but the best part is that Lightening McQueen's headlights light up -not to mention the shoes have lightning's face on the top and front of the shoe (eyes on the velcro part and mouth on the front of the shoe) and the sole of the shoe looks like the under part of a car.  My son demands to put them on first thing in the morning and stomps around in them all day.  when he isn't wearing them he is tapping them on the floor to watch them light up... also, before these, I have struggled to get him to wear shoes longer than 5 minutes, but wearing these are like some kind of fun game for him.  I highly recommend these to anyone who's child is a fan of the movie.",the best toddler shoes ever!,B000I2XAJS

"Of course my 2-year old loved these shoes, but they have sewn a rather tight piece of elastic under the tongue and velcro closure that makes it very difficult to get on.  This isn't mentioned in the item description. As another reviewer did, I cut the elastic with scissors and the shoes worked well - but I didn't expect to have to do that to a brand-new pair of shoes.  Seems like a design flaw.",Hard to put on,B000I2XA5M

The heel is made of a heavy rubber that won't wear out quickly.  We love the velcro straps, it makes it easier for kids to get these on & off, and not to mention no more untied shoe hazards.

"I purchased this item for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she has a very small wrist so I figured a girls watch would be the perfect fit. When the item arrived I noticed it did not work, upon reading the instructions I figured out that there was supposed to be a plastic tab under the crown to keep the crown pulled out so the battery did not run down. There was no plastic tab and the crown was pushed in, dead battery! I called the manufacturer and asked what to do, they told me I could send it to them but it would take 4-6 weeks to replace the battery and if I had it replaced locally it would viod the 5 year warranty. I asked to speak to another rep as I was not pleased, they did not pack it properly according to their own instructions, if they had put the tab in the crown in the first place the battery would not be dead. My thinking is that no one wants to send in a watch and wait 4-6 weeks for a return, not to mention that their manual also states that the battery life is only 2 years meaning that at some point in the 5 year warranty period you will have to send the watch in to them..and wait 4-6 weeks for them to replace the battery. These people at Activa could learn a thing or two about service from the Amazon reps, even the AMazon guy said that was insane. Kudos to AMazon for taking care of the issue and rushing me a new watch overnight, I hope it actually works as Christmas is in 3 days, but hey at least Amazon tried.",Bad Out Of The Box,B000NID7JU

"I bought these for my wife and she loves them as much as I do!! They are very sexy and my wife actually enjoys wearing them more than pantyhose. My wife is 5'5"" and is very shapely and voluptuous. We bought the Q1 size and it was just a little tight in the thighs, so we are going to try the Q2 size. Hopefully, the Q2 provides a little more room in the thigh without being too long. The Q1 stockings come right up to her bottom. You most likely won't be able to wear a garter with them because of how high they go, but you also don't need a garter because of the silicone that does a great job of keeping them up. We bought the Coffee color because the nude is a little too nude and the whole reason for wearing these is for them to be seen!!

-the nylon has started to separate from the lace top,
-stay-put rubber on the lace starts to itch/burn after sitting for a bit,
-instead of mid-thigh, the lace starts at just above the knee

The company was very very helpful in dealing with it (replaced the hose with another kind, refunded my money, and offered to cover any medical expenses). Mr Mayer called me multiple times to follow up and make sure I was doing ok. They insisted that it was an allergic reaction to the silicone, which I can assure you it was not- it felt and looked like friction. Overall, I recommend the company but not this product.
  EDIT: It turns out I am allergic to silicone. Not the company's fault at all-- just be aware that the possibility exists.","Pretty, but not worth the blisters",B00008IP9F
"Wore these recently and found them to be fine for the first 3-4 hours then the foot area seems to react to (maybe sweat) and the hose becomes slightly rouger and more irritable.

I found that Hanes silk reflections did not have the same problem and look every bit as good.

"If you're the kind of person who has trouble with slippage these are great. They stay up really well, but they are definitely for people with thinner thighs, and they are shorter in length than some other brands.

Unfortunately, the medium size was sent instead of a large and he could barely squeeze into the pair we got. So my review is going to be based on my observations of the materials and construction of the pants rather than how they functioned out in the snow and rain.

The pants are made of a fine 100% polyester ripstop fabric with a water repellent finish that really does resist water. I poured a little water on one of the legs of the pant and it just rolled off. The pants have taped seams, three rows of stitched elastic at the waist to keep the pants close fitting, a pair of zipped pockets, and each leg has an ankle side zipper to help with boots and such. The quality of manufacturing is evident just looking at the pants. The construction is such that these pants should really do their job of keeping kids dry and warm while they are playing outside or just out in the harsh weather.

I think these pants are well made and should last for several seasons of playing in the snow and rain. Do they make them for adults? I  hope so.",Marmot PreCip Kids' Waterproof Rain/Hiking Pants are really good to keep kids dry in rain and snow,B000O6Z00U
"Well, I tried these out more thoroughly than I would have expected... I ordered these for my son to grow into, and ended up borrowing them for myself! I am a petite female - 5'5"", 110 pounds wearing a large,  in case you're planning to try them too. But enough about grown up use, let me give you a practical review.

These are very thin, which is actually my favorite part. We mostly use waterproof pants for mild winters in Oregon. I like that these can just slide on top of whatever pants my son is wearing. They take up hardly any space at all when packing. And they wash great.

Yesterday, I wore them outside in pouring rain for two hours. When I came back in, even my waterproof Eddie Bauer coat had absorbed some water. But these pants were dry within 20 minutes and every rain drop just beaded on the surface. If you're looking for waterproof, these are certainly that.",These worked so well against the rain that I borrowed them for myself!,B000O6Z00U
"These are much lighter than I expected and I think they are more to wear over your pants than to wear as pants alone, though you could probably do that too. (If playing in the snow then you definitely need to wear warm pants underneath these.) The material reminds me of the material used in very light (single layered) windbreakers. We haven't had any rain or snow where we are yet, but I did throw these in the wash and they are water resistant! I took the pants out and ended up splashing water everywhere. All our other clothes absorbed the water but the water just flew off of these pants.

A plus for being able to wear these over pants: this will make it so much easier to come into the house after playing in the snow. I always make my son change into dry pants at the door so he doesn't drip melting snow all over the house. With this your child can just take it right off without having to change.","Light, seems to work",B000O6Z00U
"These are great water-proof pants for kids. While marketed and made to protect children from rain and other water, they are a must have for cold weather climates, where there is a significant amount of snow. They are great for older children who will refuse to wear ""little kid"" snow pants, even though they still need the protection from the wetness that playing in the snow will bring. These unisex pants have a lot of great features: a comfortable, elastic waist, a couple of zippered pockets, zippers at the bottom of the legs to help them to easily slide on/off over boots, as well as an adjustable snap closure for the cuffs to keep snow and dampness out.

They are super lightweight, but offer great protection. In fact, you can even roll them up into a pretty small package and they will fit easily into a backpack for use when needed. These are also machine washable, and easy care all around. And, most importantly, my grandson really likes them, too. 5 stars.","Stylish & Practical, Kid Approved!",B000O6Z00U

"After having worn leather-band watches for years, I wanted to to get a little more stylish by choosing a metal-band watch but was afraid I would not achieve the same comfort with a metal watch.
I am happy to say that this Kenneth Cole watch sits on my wrist perfectly and is actually more comfortable than the leather-band watches I have owned.
In addition to comfort, the watch is obviously stylish, as the photo above depicts, and it is very easy to read the time even when it is relatively dark, thanks to the silver watch background and the luminescent white strips integrated into the watch hands.  Finally, having the date on the watch is a welcome addition that I have not had on any of my current watches.
For $95, this watch is a bargain.","Perfect watch--combines comfort, style, and utility",B000068X4M

"I bought this Lego Bionicle Rakshi watch as a gift for my nephew's birthday.  If you have never played with Lego toys and don't know a thing about Bionicles, you're in for a challenge.  For starters, the instructions are minimal.  Also, there's no picture on how the finished product should look like to guide you. My nephew and I spent some time figuring out what that black ball piece was for and where that red strange piece should go. It was fun but also a bit frustrating.  In the end, it took two grown-ups to solve the mystery on how to put the Bionicle head together and how to mount it on the watch.  But what a sense of accomplishment we all got at the end!  And the watch is pretty cool with its Bionicle head.  You can rotate it to the side or move it up and down. I also like the color scheme of gray, orange and black. The links fit tightly so the strap won't come apart easily.
People who are more familiar with Lego products would probably have put this watch together in a snap, but don't get intimidated if this watch is your very first one.  You may be at a loss for a few moments; you may get somewhat frustrated, but in the end you'll find yourself seeing how these pieces go together and that's the fun of it, and perhaps there is a lesson of patience and persistence for your kid too.",For kids and the kid in all of us,B000PXUA2A

The only con I can list is the band. It feels tremendous, and it's a perfect fit for this watch. Unfortunately, the little rubber piece that holds the loose end of the band in place broke off, and it's very expensive to get a replacement through the manufacturer.

"I bought a size 7 for my almost 7 yr old who usually wears a size 6/7 dress and a size 10 for my tall 9 yr old.  The younger daughter tried on her uniform first and it was almost down to her ankles & she swam in it. I initially thought I'd been sent a size 10 in both colours (I got Navy for her and Khaki for the older daughter). I had the 9 yr old try on the size 7 and it fit her perfectly.  Someone commented that it was stiff and I do agree but the quality is good and she's wearing leggings & a polo shirt underneath so it doesn't bother her.  Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy so I just had my older daughter keep the size 7 and exchanged her size 10 Khaki for a size 7. I got a French Toast uniform jumper for the 7 yr old.  It's lighter-weight, softer fabric and was true to size (got her a 6X).","Good quality, good price but it's HUGE!!",B000QIXWXS

I only did this review to warn others like myself who may not have realized that the shorts are actually see through in that capacity. The description says 100% poly/tricot lining, and I just figured that meant they had an opaque lining on the inside.  They are good quality, and I like the fact that the inseam is not super long, because although  my son is skinny, he wants a larger size as he prefers loose clothing around his waist, and other xl styles of basketball shorts tend to fall far below his knees. For that reason, I do wish that they had the lining so I could keep them because the fit is fine. I got them for him to use in gym class, but unfortunately I don't think the school would like him wearing see through shorts -nor would I, so i am returning them.  just a ""heads-up"" for people like me who don't realize that they are not lined like the type of shorts you'd find at say, K***'s.",The lining is same as outer shell...,B000U60N6U

 RE: 105-524-8542-5052222

Unfortunately, I am unable to rate your products. I ordered  2 suits size 18 for my twin sons on March 21,2008, I received one suit and it was two small. I called and spoke with Nathan Jacobi on March 31,2008 to let him know that I was returning the one suit that I did receive for a size 20. Per Nathan Jacobi, once I told him that I did not receive the second suit he will make sure that I do not receive the second suit it and I should return the first suit and once that is received Nathan will sent me both suit size 20.

To my surprise I did receive the second suit size 18 on April 1,2008 and I had to return both suits on April 1,2008 and was charged $12.30. UPS expected delivery date was Monday, April 7, 2008 tracking number 1Z010X360330864493.

Now, it is May 2, 2008 and I have not yet received my 2 suits size 20. I am very disappointed with the length of time it takes to receive returned items.

At first I was very excited when I came upon your website, having 2 sons, actually 3 sons and being a spiritually family to see such suits that are of such quality, I just  knew I no longer wanted to buy my son' suits anywhere else.

I would like my order as soon as possible. We have several spiritually events coming up this summer and I would like to receive my order all at once. Please don't misunderstand, I know  at times there can/will be delays. However, this is now a little over a month and my sons are suit less.

"Orange was my daughters favorite color last year and she wanted a new bike. My parents wanted me to order this bike so they will have a nice Xmas gift for her. My father assembled this bike and when we got home my little one started to use it in the house right away, and we realize that there is a problem with turning right or left because the bike was very stiff. The steering handles would not turn . We applied more oil and loosened the screws a little to make it turn. It did not help and in the spring we thought when she starts use it , it would work. But it did not and she fell off the bike many times because she could not steer. It is very dangerous for her and I must purchase another bike for her. I would never buy this brand again.

"Bought two of these for my 4 year old twins.  They went together easily, looked okay (well, as okay as green and orange can), etc.  But, one of them wasn't able to pedal.  Turns out, the pedal was sticking at the top (i.e. when you need it to carry over, since you have no leverage on the pedal).  Then the other one started doing it.  This was the day they got them.  I took the bearings out, repacked them with synthetic grease (much slicker), and put back together, only left it a little looser.  WOrked okay for another 5 minutes.  Then the same thing kept happening.  The pedals also are very sticky, and don't rotate well.  This might be all well and fine for an older kid who is stronger, but just doesn't work with young kids trying to learn how to ride.  To make it worse, they have both become very frustrated with trying to learn to pedal (tricycles are no problem, they ""get"" the concept).  If I can't find a place to get new bearings for the cranks, I'll probably get rid of them.

Basically, for the price, I expected a functional bike that probably wouldn't really hold out too well.  That's fine, they are learner's bikes - training wheels, and all.

"This set of 2 pairs of overalls is adorable and was a great price when I bought it. Came with hats which as others have noted are not good hats but he likes to play with them and they will actually go on his head and he's in the 80th head circumference so that's saying something :) The embroidered appliques alone are worth the price though shipping was a tad pricey. The shirts aren't onesies but open bottom, and there are no snaps on the legs which we love because our son likes to open all the leg snaps. Perfect for going through a diaper exploring phase too if that is happening! With the adjustable straps, you can really change the size/length more to kind of wear them a bit before and a bit beyond a size. I'd say they are actually a bit large, don't order up a size for sure.",So cute,B0011CZKB0

"The outfit arrived quickly and I was very pleased with the quality of the overalls. They are well made and look great on my son.  I actually ordered this specific set as the train conductor's part of my son's Halloween costume because it came with a matching hat that looked like it would be perfect.(My husband made an awesome Thomas the Train out of a box that my son could wear with suspenders to hold the box on my son's shoulders). I figured it would also serve as an outfit later on. I was very disappointed with the hat that came with it, however.  It was too small for my son to wear and the costume just wasn't as cute as it could have been. I was surprised that the hat was too small because my son is 2 1/2 years old and the outfit was a 4T (My son is extremely tall for his age).","Good Quality, good price, small hat",B0011CZKB0

"I received the watch earlier than projected delivery date.  Although my wife wanted a leather band, she loves the watch and the band.  It was easy to remove links from the band and ended up with a perfect fit and the clasp makes it easy to fasten and release.  I had a Seiko digital watch (Seiko apparently stopped making digital) many years ago until I dropped it on a concrete floor from 8' up.  It had kept perfect time.  The point here is I have confidence in the Seiko name on a watch.  The style, size and appearance are exactly what my wife was looking for.

A nit, which applies to other (all??) watch manufacturers, is that it does not include any instructions for removing links from the band.  I said it was easy because I had recently removed links from another watch.

Since she has had it for only ten days, I can't say much more.  I am hoping it will perform as well and last as long as my Seiko digital did.",My wife loves the watch,B0000V9RH6

"I had bought the Armitron Kung Fu Panda watch as a birthday gift for my fiance as she loves the movie and loves watches. So I was excited when I came across this watch on Amazon.

When I received it, it was a beautiful watch, gorgeous leather strap and beautiful face. It's definitely not a kid size watch--size is appropriate for adult male or teenager. I did notice that the hands of the watch were not moving. I was going to return it but then I saw the amazon notice in the box stating that sometimes the watch may not work because it may be a wind up watch or solar, so I figured it was one of those types of watches as I have never had any problems with any amazon orders.

My fiance came to visit me (long distance relationship) for her birthday and she LOVED the watch!!! Problem was we realized that it wasn't a wind up watch or solar and it was past the 30 days when I bought it. I felt embarrased giving her a watch that didn't work, she said it was okay, so we went to get a battery placed in it and it worked for a few hours and then it stopped. Something was wrong with it. I was really disappointed, had I not seen that Amazon notice, I would've returned it right away or at least exchanged it because the watch is beautiful and my fiance loved it. I'd highly suggest next time even if you've always been happy with amazon that if you buy a watch and even if it's a gift (especially) to go ahead and open the box and read through the manual to make sure it's a wind up watch, battery operated or solar, that way if it doesn't work you can return it within the 30 day window and not be embarrased when you give a broken watch as a gift.",Kung Fu Panda Armitron Watch,B00188216Y

"I ordered this watch for my almost 5 year old grandson who loved the kung fu panda movie. It is a beautiful well made watch, but it is definitely not a kid's watch as advertised.

I am keeping the watch until my grandson is older. Hope he still remembers kung fu panda when he is old enough to wear the watch.

"My daughter enjoys being able to slip on and off these shoes.  They fit well even though she has a narrow foot.  I gave these shoes 4 stars because the top and sides you see in white are made of a soft mesh material- I would prefer them made of something more durable, like leather.  But so far so good, no rips or tears yet.  Overall a good shoe.",School shoes,B000C4WIKY

This watch is beautiful. The picture is okay but when it is in your hands you realise how good it really looks. I got my watch when my sister did and it made her watch look cheap.

"I've used Casios for many years and after the last one died after only two years, I started searching for a nice looking watch for a reasonable price.  After eliminating countless models from Casio through Heuer, I rediscovered Timex, a brand I hadn't bought in 20 years.

I was concerned about the watch's face and band being too blue, but the color is quite dark.  The light blue accents on the band look good.  So far the case and glass face are quite durable.  I paid something like $38--I would have trouble getting a metal cased Casio for this money.

I wonder about the battery life since I can hear the sweep second hand move from 8 inches away--must take a lot of battery power to generate that sound, which I believe is by design.",Nice looking watch for the money,B0000TIIKK

"I've used these for years and love them.  They're especially useful in the spring & summer, when I wear thinner tops.  I guess my body's different from that of the previous reviewer, because these always work just fine for me.  Only once have I found that the petal shape showed through my clothes, and that was when I was wearing a thin top with no bra.  But I usually use these under my thinner, unlined bras, so I can wear a bra that doesn't add bulk while still being able to wear a t-shirt or other thin/clingy top.  I go through at least one or two packages of these a month in the warm weather, and I love the convenience of being able to throw them away at the end of the day, rather than having to wash them as with silicone ones.

However, if I had seen these shoes in person I probably wouldn't have bought them, unless my daughter was with me, of course.

"I am not one that usually purchases designer name brand items but I saw this watch several years ago on a shopping channel and the price was rather expensive.
I was looking online and found the exact time piece on Overstock.com for $399.00. I also got a $50.00 discount and free shipping. I anticipated the arrival of the watch and was
expecting to find a subpar wristwatch that was not as nice as described. To my amazement, the watch was amazingly well made and designed. Mine had the croc strap that would be difficult
to replace. I was able to adjust the strap to a size that would fit my large wrist. A friend of mine saw the watch and immediately wanted one also. I told him about the deal and he ordered the watch immediately. He did not like the leather strap so he ordered a s/s band from SWI. The strap cost more than he paid for the watch. It was a mesh design and although it looked ok on him, it wasn't something I would wear.
I got many comments on the watch when I wore it and it kept perfect time for an automatic.
As noted, the watch was well made and I found out that the watch was manufactured by EBEL. I believe Timex owns the name now but, it certainly isn't a Timex.
I no longer have the watch as it was stolen from me along with my other watches.
It was one of my favorite however and I miss it.",Great Designer Time Piece,B00028GAZ4

"I'm an adult and have a small wrist.  I have a hard time finding a watch that will fit my small wrist and actually keep water out.  I tried this one because I figured Speedo makes things for swimming and so probably it might actually keep water out (unlike the 4 Timex watches that are in my watch graveyard from the last year).  It actually works!  The functions aren't quite as intuitive as others, but you get used to them.  Since it kind of looks ""jelly"" like, I've gotten actual compliments at work from the 20-somethings since that's apparently ""in"" now.  I swim for exercise a couple of times a week and I can read my watch while I swim.  My favorite feature is how the watch closes.  The holes in the band fit over a small nub that stands up from the buckle.  It is far more secure than a traditional close.  I'm actually going to buy another watch like this in another color because I like it so much.",A waterproof watch that fits,B001HZXYK0

"I bought this expecting to get the blue electronic Tommy watch they had sold at Burger King when the first movie came out, the very same watch I had adored as a young boy. I literally counted the days for my watch to arrive so I could hear that lovable baby say ""A baby's got to do, what a baby's got to do."". When I opened the package and saw none other than Chuckys nerdy face instead of Tommy's bald-headed charm, I went ballistic. Nonetheless, I am extremely complacent and am wearing it right now.

Other than being completely disappointed, it is a pretty standard watch. The batteries were dead upon arrival which makes it unusable, but those can be replaced. The scratch and sniff banana print on the watch smells like a combination of plastic and bananas, a bit pleasant if you like odd smells. If you're a fan of Chucky from the series, get it. If you're a casual shopper looking for some items that cause massive amounts of Tommy related nostalgia, be prepared to be disapointed.","""Tommy""",B001J7MEBG

This swimsuit and skirt are absolutely precious and perfect for my daughter's Luau themed Birthday Party. My daughter wears a 2t right now but I decided to order a size up in the suit. I am glad that I did because it fits her perfectly. The 2t would have been too small. The band around the skit is elastic so there is some give in it but it is pretty snug. Great Price point too.

"These boots are beautifully crafted, but they are not for everyone. They are narrow, as past reviewers mentioned. I am a 9B, so they are great, but for those who are used to a roomier footbed), these boots may not be for you. I also am a bit puzzled by the tongue of the boot. It seems to be crafted on a slight angle and to not lay as flat as I expected when the boot is laced up. I was concerned that it would cause unnecessary rubbing of my ankle. I have now worn these boots a number of times to break them in and soften the tongue so it molds better to my ankle. There are real pluses to the boot. It is attractive, durable and has the stiffer sole I require to protect my arches. I am looking forward to wearing these boots for years to come.",Danner boot for women-- sizing and fit,B0002L4O1S

So when he opened up this watch on Christmas morn he was SO happy!  It's dark enough that the decorations aren't obnoxious and the watch doesn't really appear to be a ""kid's watch"" from a distance, but it's decorated with horseshoes and horses and is SO neat... even the second hand is a horse moving around the middle, quite the neat design!  It keeps accurate time and seems like very high quality as well.

My son is in 3rd grade and he has no problem telling the time; the numbers are easy to see and figure out.  So that's a plus... no vague dots that are confusing at this age. Very well thought out!

I've had my pair for about 8 years. I do take care of them, and I expect them to last for many more years to come, although I plan on having the soles replaced sometime before next hunting season.

"I bought this pair of boots about seven years ago in Fairbanks, AK. I wanted a stiff hunting boot that would last a lifetime, and this boot does not disapoint. The soles are round and are made for very uneaven terrain do not use on pavement or around town unless the roads are muddy, unpaved, or rocky. There is insulation but you really have to keep active otherwise your toes will get cold and once these boots get cold your done these boots are so thick that it is inpossible to get your feet warm again unless you take them off in a heated cabin. Example I wore these boots to a village in western Alaska they provided great staibility being made of thick quality leather and stiff rugged soles. Walking on these unmaintained roads with ice and packed snow was great, walked about two miles from the village airstrip to the meeting hall no problems at all. The weather was too cold for my day hikers but not cold enough for bunny boots or my really cold weather boots, so I wore these. When the meeting was finished and I was waiting at the airstrip for my scheduled flight my toes froze; plane was ninty minutes late, temp was about 4 to -4 degrees F with north winds blowing in the teens. Once on the plane (Caravan) it took the whole fourty-five minutes ride back to Nome to get the feeling back into my toes, the pain of the blood returning to my toes was pretty bad, not a problem with the boot mind you but if you need a boot and you plan to be static for any amount of time in cold weather look eslewhere. So I will countine to use these boots for fall moose hunting and caribou hunting in September and October only, these really are fantistic boots for this purpose. Breaking in these boots take forever, so beaware of that.",Great,B0002L4BH0

It is the perfect size; not too big, not too small, especially for me with my smaller wrist. I've never had a problem with it; the winder hasn't stuck like one of the previous reviewers mentioned. It even took a licking and kept on ticking in the 4 months that I studied abroad in Egypt.

Remember, you are getting a $50 watch here, so it's not made out of the absolute highest quality materials. But if you can't spend $1000 or $100 on a watch, but you still want something classy that catches the eye and holds up over time, then this is a sure bet.

P.S. I have the version that has the all-silver band, not the one pictured with the gold and silver band.","Reliable, eye-catching watch",B0002M9RZA

Now I have 2 pairs feeling like I am kinda getting ripped off cause of shipping.  There was a 11.99 fee for shipping each time I ordered ithem.

"When I opened the package and saw the suit, I was literally shocked at how shiny and bright it was. I was kind of like, "" uh, no. Sending it back."" So I put it back in the box. Then took it out again a few hours later. Then tried it on. It's a little big, but still snug enough to stay on during long runs, long swims in the pool, and long swims in the lake, even with the wavy water.
What I also like about this suit, aside from the bright and shiny design, is that it's lined with black fabric, so there's no see-through going on.
I don't swim quickly, but the material seems kind of bulky for speed, so if you're looking for an aerodynamically efficient suit, this might not be it.

The ringbearer was gleeful to receive this watch. I originally ordered it from Amazon and they sourced it to Target. I ordered it on July 10 and as we approached July 31 I revisited Amazon to see that Round Rock Distributing had the item available and could ship immedeately. It arrived on July 31 after ordering the week before. It is now Aug 11 and still nothing from Target. Target does not recognize the lego number. Round Rock did great and the ring bearer spent the wedding and reception twisting and adjusting the watch. Great gift for a 1st grader. So far no complaints a week later.

Target knows nothing about this item. Past product? There is no way to email amazon to ask them to cancel the order or rail at them for their obstinance. The latest estimate is Aug 27-31.

Very upset. And a huge waste of money.  My son needed white open bottom sweatpants for a play he was in.  I searched white open bottom sweat pants and got this site.

"My kid loved it! Product looks just like the picture. Battery life good. It was shipped very fast... good service.
Unfortunately my daughter fidgeted with it to set time and it doesn't work anymore.. :(",Very cute!,B00284C9NW
"I bought this for my daughter who loves frogs. It's a cute watch, but we have not been able to get the straps to stay on. The straps keep sliding through the metal piece and it eventually falls off her wrist.",Just okay,B00284C9NW
I ordered this watch for me to wear at work. I am a cook in an Elementary school and I do wash dishes and I don't worry about this watch getting wet.,Watch,B00284C9NW
Our grandson really loved the watch. It's going to give him an opportunity to learn how to tell time in a fun way.,Perfect,B00284C9NM
"My grandson has had this watch exactly one day so I can only rate it according to my first impressions. The dial is uncluttered and thus easy for a 4 year old who is just learning to tell time to read. Band is colorful and very cute. It seems sturdy. I may up the rating to 5 stars given some time to see how the watch wears and how durable it is. So far, so good!","Grandson loves new ""fire engine"" watch",B00284C9NM
The Fire Truck band is hard to find in stock.  Be aware that due to the difficulty in finding... the price is usually high!!!!  The band will fade over time.  The last one my kids had lasted about a year.,My wife loves this particular band....,B00284C9NM
"I ordered this watch for my grandson, and another of the same ""first-watch"" type by Timex for my granddaughter.  The bands on both looked like they were worn out.  Not impressed with the quality, but the face of the watch is quite good and will hopefully make learning to tell time a bit easier.",band looks faded and worn out,B00284C9NM
"Being a Timex, I knew it would be sturdy.  This was purchased for my three-year old grandson and he loves it.  He is into any kind of vehicle and it also fits well.  When he saw it, he said ""My first watch!  Just what I always wanted!""",Timex Kids' Fire Trucks Elastic Band Watch,B00284C9NM
"This watch is adorable and my 3 y.o. son loves it. However, as soon as it arrived of course he wanted to wear it to the park (what little boy wouldn't). Had I known we would come home with the face completely scratched (an unreasonable amount no matter what he was doing!), I would not have let him. The watch is essentially ruined after one outing.",Scratches Easily,B00284C9NM
where the band meets the watch the leather pulled off and there's a plastic thing holding it on but the kid says it doesnt feel comfortable now with that piece of leather detached.,great for kids but the band tore,B0028QGNJ6
daughter loved it,great stockin stuffer,B0028QGFGM
my granddaughter was giggly happy with the watch and the princess that she received for her 5th birthday.  wished i could show here face and big hugs.,birthday surprise,B0028QGFGM
"My son loves this watch, and it is helping him learn how to tell time.  The fact that the three hands are different makes it a lot easier for him.  I also love how sturdy it is.  It has been coated with mud, accidently worn in the bathtub, and banged up against many things; but it shows no signs of wear (and the correct time).  The leather strap is great because it fits my son's skinny wrist much better than a cloth one would.  I am very happy that I bought this watch for my son.",It has held up for our rough and tumble 4 year old,B0028QGOFY
"My daughter absolutely LOVED her watch. Only problem is, I guess she loved it too much. She wore it everyday and seems the leather right where the watch attaches to the face came apart. I've tried taking it to a regular watch dealer to have a new band put on but they say it's disney so they can't do it. :( Still need to find someone to repair.",Nice but...,B0028QGG6G
Very nice watch and easy for my 5 and 8 year old to start learning to tell time. the only reason i gave it a 4 not a 5 is because it is a bit small. The numbers on the inside are difficult to read but maybe that is me in my old age. In any case it is a good watch for the price.,Great for a beginner but a bit small,B0028QGNXM
I work in a power plant and am on my feet all day long.  These boots are so comfortable I'm thinking about buying another pair just to have for good.  The arch support is awesome. These really are extremely comfortable.  I can come home after an eight hour day & not be dead on my feet!,Comfort!!,B0002PYJFA
Its missing the set screw,Four Stars,B0000YBNN4
"Watch is a bit larger than I thought.  I have a thin, boney wrist, and removed the only two removable links on the bottom side of the face, but it still sits too far to the top side when clasped. Wish I could remove one more on the bottom side so it would be tighter.  When the band moves on my arm it tends to catch hairs in the deep recess between the outer links.  The center row of mirror-polished stainless steel links in the band get scratched in everyday wear.  But... watch looks nice even though not totally comfortable.  Quality of watch and crystal seems good.","Nice looking, but..",B0000YBNN4
Watch was what I expected and arrived when I thought I'd get it.,Nice watch!,B0000YBNN4
very very nice,Five Stars,B002CVTOS4
"I purchased this watch for my granddaughter's birthday. She called with excitement in her voice to say how wonderful it was because she was learning to tell time and she loved the ""Glow"" feature.",A Perfect Gift,B002CVTOS4
"I am an adult who bought this watch for myself.  I wanted something simple with no complicated control buttons to push.  This has numbers big enough for me to read, yet is small and light weight.  I like the indiglo feature which allows me to light up the screen with a push of the single button on the watch.  I even like the adjustable elastic band.  It is the most comfortable watch band I've ever had.  This watch suits me well!",I love this watch!,B002CVTOS4
"The hands on the hour, minute and second markers are different colors. The numbers are very easily readable. It's got a great backlight for seeing at night (and just to play around with for the kids). It is also water proof so I don't bother having them remove it in the bath or for swimming. They keep it on at all times and enjoy learning how to read time. It's perfect for what it does and at a great price too.",Excellent Product for a child's first Watch,B002CVTOS4
"My daughter, who is 6 years old, really liked the look of it, but she has really small wrist so it was hard to tighten it enough and have it feel comfortable.  The numbers showing 5, 10, 15... are really small, but I guess you can't expect them to be too big on this size watch.  Her eyes can see them better than mine.  Basically it is cute and functional.",Ok for a First Watch,B002CVTOS4
We bought this for my daughter's 7th birthday so she can learn how to tell time. It's neat because each second is marked (1-60)to help her learn.  My daughter loves the design and color of this watch and the fact that the second hand is a heart!,Good for a kid's watch.,B002CVTOS4
"The first watch received did not work.  I was impressed how easy it was to return plus getting a credit for the return shipping.

The watch is adorable and great tool to increase the skill of telling time.",Timex Kids Watch,B002CVTOS4
"I bought this watch for my niece and she loved it, especially the indiglo feature.",great gift!,B002CVTOS4
"Although I liked the idea of a stretch band, it is not well-secured and loosens too easily.  I also loved the idea of the teaching numbers for the minutes.  However, they are very difficult to see.  I think they should have been in bolder print.  The crystal is very cheap plastic and scratched on the first day.  The girls like that it lights up and the designs are very pretty.  I guess it isn't bad for an inexpensive first watch.","Nice watch, band is not well secured",B002CVTOS4
Even fit my tiny 6 year old.  Easy to read.  Cute as can be!  Timex has a one year if you lose it they replace it for [...].,Great little girl watches.,B002CVTOS4
"I bought this watch for my 7 year old daughter. She has been extremely happy with the watch which in turn makes me happy with the product. The watch so far has held up well to the wear and tear that a 7 year old can inflict. I have bought my children other watches that after only a short period of time the crystal was so scratched that you could not even read it to tell the time.
The crystal on this watch has held up extremely good.
She loves the INDIGLO feature also and plays with it often. The watch has also proven to be a good reinforcement to her learning to tell time.
I would highly recommend this watch!",Timex Kids' T7B431 IDIGLO? Hearts Stretch Band Watch,B002CVTOTS
We bought this watch for our 7 year old daughter.  The band is great...so easy to put on and take off and not have to adjust each time.  She loves the easy to read face and the indiglo feature.,great watch,B002CVTOTS
"I purchased this as a Valentine's Day gift for my 6 year old and it was a hit!  She wears it constantly, is really learning to tell time and it fits perfectly thanks to the adjustable strap. I definitely recommend this to the little lady in your life!",SHE LOVED IT!!!,B002CVTOTS

"This watch was a birthday gift for my 10 year old daughter.  She really liked it and was excited to have her first watch. I specifically purchased a water resistant/proof watch because I know anything delicate would be ruined pretty quickly.  The first time she went swimming with the watch on, it fogged up and stopped working. I contacted Amazon customer service and they sent a replacement overnight at no cost to me. I sent the broken one back and the new one has not failed us. Thanks, Amazon. Good product, good policy.",Replacement Watch Is Truly Waterproof!,B002CVTOQQ
"Perfect for my granddaughters birthday and 1st watch.  There was a problem that happened in packing and was able to be knocked about, but as they use to say ""it's  still ticking, it's  a Timex""",it's a timex!!!,B002CVTOQ6
"I'm happy with the watch now that it is working, but the battery was dead when I received it.  Since I needed it quickly I replaced the battery myself, but I am not happy with the added expense and bother.",Battery was dead!,B002CVTOQ6

"The Easter bunny brought this for my 9 year old daughter. 2 years later she still likes it. Nice for the 'tween who doesn't want a cartoon character or ""heartthrob"" watch.",nice durable watch for 'tween,B002CVTOQ6
My 9 year old can't live without this watch.  She loves it!  Wears it day and night.  It easy to put on and is comfortable and durable.,great watch for kid,B002CVTOQ6
"We love the Timex kids' watches because they are reliable, and even a five year old can slip it on easily by himself/herself.  My son loves the dinosaurs, and it's wonderful that he wears it because he will look at a digital clock, then at his watch, and he is teaching himself analog time.  Timex makes another watch with a velcro black strap that has Indiglo - my older son prefers that one and he can handle putting on the watch strap himself.  I do wish this watch had Indiglo, but otherwise it is a good, inexpensive, reliable watch.",Good starter watch,B002CVTOSE
"My kids really love the Timex Kids' Time Teacher watches - we have one with a purple monkey stretch band and one with a blue band with cars and trucks.  We looked around for the longest time before finding these watches - our kids wanted watches, but we really struggled to find simple, inexpensive analog kids' watches (you'd think it would be pretty simple!).

PROS
+ display is very easy to read

+ band has cool and interesting graphics on it that kids want to wear

+ inexpensive watch

+ your kids learn to tell time with a real watch

+ durable watch

+ watch is easy to put on

CONS
- Not all of the watches seem to have a second hand

- Not all of the watches are as legible as others

- No date feature on the watch

All in all, very much recommend the Timex Kids Time Teacher Purple Monkey as well as Timex Kids Time Teacher Blue Cars and Trucks Stretch Band Watches, as well as others of the same basic design from Timex.",Great watch!,B002CVTOSE
"Kids loved these watches, they are easy to wear & fun. The ""glow in the dark"" feature is especially cool for the kids!",kids loved it!,B002CVTOSE
"I love this watch! It is a kids watch, but with the elastic band fits most people. It takes a beating and is good quality for the money.",Timex Cars watch great.,B002CVTOT8
"So, this isn't the most exciting thing to get a 4-year-old, but toys aren't everything people. The light works fine and it's nice quality, but the strap is a bit lame in that there is usually a flap of it dangling when he wears it. It's a soft elastic, so not too much of a bother, but I don't want to cut it and create a possibility of it unraveling.",birthday gift for 4-year-old,B002CVTOT8
"The watch looks great (size, color, design are awesome) BUT we received a defective one and, under Timex's warranty terms, all shipping costs to get it fixed are at our charge. Quicker and cheaper to buy a new one but I am really mad at Timex for its non-customer oriented service !!",defective item,B002CVTOT8
"My 3-yr-old son loves this watch. We've had it for about 6 months now and he still wants to wear it all the time. It's very durable and practical. My only complaint is that the watch band tends to slip over time. Basically, the teeth on the buckle are not sharp enough to hold the elastic band in place very long. This could be fixed by getting a different band or finding a difference buckle. You could probably jury-rig something to get it to work better. I just haven't had the time to do it yet myself. Otherwise, this is an outstanding watch with an unbeatable warranty, especially for a children's product.",Excellent kids watch!,B002CVTOT8
"My son (7) loves this watch. It is very lightweight, and the INDIGLO light is fun. The band is stretchy - I set it once, and now he can simply pull the watch on and off his wrist without fiddling with the buckle. He likes when people comment how ""grown up"" he looks with a watch.",Great boy's watch,B002CVTOT8
"If your boy knows how to read a clock, chances are he'll like this Indiglo watch from Timex.  It keeps accurate time. The face and numerals are clear and it lights up in the dark (like in a movie theater) when you push the button.

These days, there are very few watches to choose from for kids - almost none in the stores.  Our son likes analog because he can figure out how much time he has to do something.  The band is good too.",Great young boy's watch,B002CVTOT8
My six year old son is very happy with this watch.  However the fastening device would not secure the straps; I glued a bit of Velcro to each trap in order to hold the watchband together.,Nice watch,B002CVTOT8
"I purchased this watch for my son for Christmas.  This is the perfect little starter watch for a small child.  It has an elastic band that can adjust to any size wrist.  It is easy to read and seems very durable.  My son especially loves the indiglo feature.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the band can get twisted sometimes...not totally kid proof.

For the price and quality, it is a perfect starter watch for any child!",Great Kid's watch!,B002CVTOT8
"got this for my 7 year old. elastic band was odd but really practical for this age. glows in the dark when you press a button. nice to have him learn how to tell time without looking at a digital watch. not too kiddie looking, he thinks it's cool. would be better if it was waterproof.",great watch for boys,B002CVTOT8

"Got this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old. He loves it. The band adjusts enough for him to wear it (and he's a small guy). I can't say how long-lasting it will be, but so far, so good. For any child who loves Spiderman, this is a great gift.",Good for kids,B002KHMXTC
"This watch is fun, and everyone compliments my son when he wears it, the problem is that the band pinches his arm.  It is that cheaper type of material that they make kids watches with.  It seems to work well, and it hasn't broken yet.  It does have a metal closure, that seems to be where the pinching comes from.  I remember having something similar when I was a kid.  I definitely paid too much for this.  I wish it had a cloth/velcro band.  For the price I paid, I hate to spend anymore to try and make it work.","Keeps time, quality is okay, but not comfortable",B002KHMXTC

"People always comment on this watch when they see it.  The mesh band stands out, and on closer inspection everyone loves the slim profile.  I do too - when you're wearing dress shirts, it slides under the cuff without catching.  The design is simple but elegant, and the face is easy to read.  My only complaint is about the crystal, which in my opinion scratches easily.  Take care not to wear it outside the office and I'm sure you'll be fine.  If you like some weight on your wrist, this is definitely not the watch for you.  If you like something unobtrusive but still eye-catching, it's hard to go wrong.",Classy watch and a great value.,B0002UD54Q
"I purchased this watch with an extra 20% off and can not believe the great deal I got.  I saw a similar watch on a disney cruise no where near as nice for much more money.

But it's nothing she can't learn soon with a little teaching from home.  Your daughter will LOVE THIS!

"We had purchased a different color of this watch for my six year old son because some of the other kids' watch I had previously bought him were broken in a short amount of time.  We liked it so much that we bought the pink one for my daughter.  Other kid watches that we have had in the past always broke because they were made of plastic or were damaged when my kids washed their hands and got the watches wet.  This one has been great.  The watch is comfortable and durable, and it is able to withstand getting wet.  The only improvement I would suggest would be to put in markers for all of the minutes so that kids who are learning to tell time can accurately see the time.","We liked the first one so much, we bought another one.",B003J9W5TS

"I'm not 7 or 12 (add a few decades to that!) but the watchband on my watch with a nice big analog clock face on it broke. Since it is difficult to find watch repair shops any more, or replacement bands in the drugstore I gave up on it and stumbled across a bunch of odd lot watches at a big department store.  As I never take my watch off it must be waterproof. I couldn't tell from any of the watches on sale whether or not they were waterproof - they were all bound rather tightly to their packaging...  I figured Speedo had to be waterproof and, sure enough, it is! It keeps good time and is waterproof for my purposes, and I guess my wrist is about the right size, so I love it.  Shortly after I bought it I stumbled across a watch hospital and got a replacement band for my other watch  but I haven't taken my little speedo off yet!",Even if you're not a Kid!,B003J9W5RU

The silver face and digital numbers are fairly low quality.  That being said, it is holding up to my son and he loves his watch.  I just wish more analog style watches were still available for kids!

The only complaint I would have is that the lid doesn't stay open, the spring snaps it shut.  I say ""would"" have because it's not really a complaint at all for my son.  He loves it.

So if you are buying for a small wrist this is perfect. And this isn't cheap material I've had mind for over a year and only using the last hook and I haven't damaged it.",I love this watch - I just wish they would put ...,B004BYEB4W
Very disappointed in this watch.  I bought it early and saved it for christmas. Within the first 10minutes of my daughter wearing it the second hand had fallen off. It wouldn't be so bad except now the other hands get stuck. I can't even exchange it cause I bought it early and saved it so my return window is closed.,Very disappointed.,B004BYEB4W
I can give it a 3 because its really cute. But i gave it to my daughter as a gift a few days ago. She wore it once and pins fell out and now its essentially broken and i will need to get it repaired. So be cautious of the tiny pins holding the heaets together. Trying to find them after they fall out is nearly impossible.,Adorable but pins easily fall out,B004BYE980

They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.  Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze.

"Although this is a kid's watch, I am a senior citizen who is thrilled to own it. First, as you can see from the illustration, it has an eminently readable face. That is crucial for a septuagenarian. The watch face is perfectly clear with a high degree of contrast. Second, it keeps great time. I haven't had to adjust the time in the months that I have owned it. Finally, I love the band. It is velcro. I have a thin wrist. My big and expensive watches slip around on my wrist because of their heavy weight and loose fit. This band, being velcro, adjusts to fit perfectly every time. I am totally satisfied with this watch.","Excellent Readable Watch, Great Band",B004JHIRIM

"I ended up having to give this watch to my husband (I bought it for myself).  The face of the watch is what I expected, but the band is huge and I must have spent about an hour trying to adjust it, which was virtually impossible.  I gave the watch to my husband - the band was too large for him (and he is six feet tall and medium build)!  Being mechanically inclined, my husband also tried diligently to adjust the band, to no avail.

And it even came with a little lego figurine that clips in the lego way to the band.  Needless to say, he loves it.

"So bought it in 3 different colors, but when it arrived two of the watches didn't work (I'm assuming the batteries were dead), and the one I gave my son (the Firefly one) for Christmas, lasted 3 days and then that battery ran out. I know these watches are fun and stay on the wrist well, especially for younger children (it fit perfectly for my son who is 10 and average size), was a tiny bit big for my daughter who is 8, but the silicon grip still worked well, and quite big for my 6-yr old (who is a skinny wee thing), and I specifically got it because the time is easy to read, the silicon grip helps the watch to stay on the wrist, and younger children don't have to fiddle around with straps and buckles, and they are waterproof which is awesome, so if they get wet, or the kids want to swim with them it is no big deal. My son loved showering with it, and thought that was really cool until the battery ran out (assuming it is the battery).

"My daughter really likes the slap-watch style and has gone through a few of them.  The first suffered a split of the rubberized cover exposing the spring metal underneath.  That took over a year to become an issue so I write it off to normal wear and tear.  The second slap watch was made with somewhat floppier rubber resulting in the watch actually popping out of the case because the flex induced by the curling of the strap around a small wrist turned the circular rubber retainer section into an oval with a big enough gap to allow the watch to fall out.  This issue was clearly the result of mediocre materials for the purpose.  The Euro Sparkle watch associated with this review is the third we have purchased and is a good unit.  It is made of a stiffer rubber and is holding up well.  Note that the watch ships from overseas so it took a while, maybe 2 weeks, to arrive here in Maryland.",Good watch for kids.

"I'm a life-long Star Trek fan. I've watched every series, movie and even the short lived cartoon series so when I saw this watch I had to have it.

Those who have actually seen the original Star Trek series staring William Shatter as James T Kirk will immediately recognize that shade of yellow and that unique font. It's a great design for any fan of the original series.

The watch has a leather band and stainless steel back. It keeps time perfectly and so far the battery is working great.

My only complaint is that the Star Fleet emblem looks a bit fuzzy on my watch, I don't know if they all have this issue but you don't notice the problem unless you're looking very close so it's not a big deal.

This watch isn't an official Star Trek product by any stretch of the imagination, but I knew it wasn't when I bought it and I'm glad I bought it. Sometimes an unofficial product can add flavor to a collection; it adds a sort of variety that official products alone can't provide.

Considering the low, low price and the quality of the product I would recommend this watch to any Star Trek collector.

"I've been wearing this watch for about a month and a half now, and it's great. It keeps time like a champ, and if anything might run a minute or two fast. The days of the week can be set to English, or French; the work days are written in black, Saturday is written in blue, and Sunday is written in red. The face is a deep sapphire blue with luminescent dots near the stick markers, and luminescent bars on the hands. It only takes a little time in bright sunlight in order for the marks to glow bright. The only issue that I had was getting it sized initially- the pins in the metal band are apparently quite tight/small, so I had to go to a watch specialist (rather than just a jewelery store) to get the band fitted. Now that it's adjusted, it's my go-to daily watch. Love it!",Great watch!,B0055XBH7W
"Gave this watch as a gift to a loved one.  She loves it, great watch, looks fantastic, but loses a few minutes every week or so, ie it gets slow by about 3-5 minutes a week.

Update:
So nearly one year on, this watch is losing about 15 minutes every week.  This isn't horrible and with some thought one just has to remember to check the time to make sure its right every so often, however, it could make someone late and speaks somewhat to the quality of the watch. If someone knows how to adjust it let me know.","Very happy, great looking watch but loses some time",B0055XBH7W

"UPDATE, 2 months later, the watch stopped running except its second hand would flail around a bit. Thinking it had a prematurely dead battery, I took it to a trusted watch shop who told me the movement had died. Junk, and not a cheap watch. Next time, I'm going digital.

This is a well-made watch. I bought it for my 5-year-old and he learned to tell time with the help of this watch and his teach me time alarm clock. A leather band and buckle can be a little fiddly for little hands, although he has mastered it, one month later. My one regret is that little fingers can't stop playing with the rotating bezel, which is the silliest idea ever. For a kid just learning to tell time, what is the point of a rotating chronometer-style bezel? The problem is, your kid will inevitably turn the bezel so it no longer has the ""60"" up (and it should say ""00"" if you ask me) and then they can't use the bezel to figure out how many minutes past the hour it is. I eventually trained my kid to make sure the ""60"" is up but it's a silly nuisance for a useless feature. The watch is at least mildly water resistant--we have not put it in the tub or anything like that, particularly because the band would likely not handle it well in the long term. Overall, given the limited choices for learning watches, this one was a solid pick, but not perfect.",A solid choice for a first watch,B005OVFDDY

I wore the watch for many years without it failing. The battery only died after I had outgrown the watch and left it sitting for some time.

My grandson loved the watch. We went to Disney World and he enjoyed it everyday.  Kids do not tell time like we do these days.  They nomally look at there cell phones for the time. It was nice to see him with it at Disney,Disney Donald Duck Watch,B005OVIX4A
"The case diameter is 30mm, but the face diameter is 24mm, which makes it hard to tell time.  It also has a blue second hand and a blue band at the edge of the bezel -- not helping much.  The numbers are small, the ""hour"" and ""minute"" labels on the hands are even smaller, and the minute counting numbers (5,10, 15, 20...) are miniscule.  The band utterly, completely sucks.  The nylon band does not have loops, it's threaded through the pins and behind the case.  The strap has 2 parts: the outer part is blue and has the velcro fold-back closure.  The inner part is sewn to the band at one end and the other end is velcro-ed to the blue band--it covers the pins.  Unfortunately, it also makes the band too stiff.  It also makes the minimum size too large for a small child.  A simple nylon band with loops would have worked much better.","Small face, hands lack contrast, very cheap band",B005OVIX4A

"I was very very disappointed with the quality of this watch. My son had to save up his pocket money for 6 weeks to buy this and within hours the poor quality began to show. Firstly the strap began to fray almost immediately when he put it on, but this is could forgive as he didn't seem to mind. Next the minute numbers around the edge of the watch began to rub off making it more difficult to read. I then noticed a crack in the glass on the face of the watch and a very rough edge to the glass which is sure to deteriorate further in the future, although this won't be much of a problem as the watch has now pretty much stopped working all together. It does make an attempt at turning it's little hands round every now and again but it is pretty pathetic.

"My son is 4 and loves this watch. The velcro closure is easy for him to work by himself. The only issue I have is what another reviewer mentioned: the outer ring rotates. I have never figured out why some adult watches have that feature, and I certainly don't understand why a kid's watch should have it. My kid turns it because he's a boy and it moves, so he has to mess with it. Other than that, it's a hit.",Almost perfect,B005PKZGRC

Often, I'll look at my 6yr old's wrist and see that the 60 minute mark has rotated 90 degrees, which, you know, isn't helpful when you're trying to teach your kid time.  Also, the face gets scratched and cloudy very easily.  Like super easy.  Within a week it had so many scratches it was hard to make out Mickey's face.

"When I first received this watch, it was not keeping good time.  After returning for warranty service, it now keeps excellent time.  After 40 days with no adjustment, it is only 3 seconds slow.  This is amazingly accurate for a mechanical movement.  Using an auto winder when not being worn, seems to help the accuracy as it is regulated to a fuller charge.

"If you like pilot watches and want a solid piece built by a reputable brand, this Fortis fits the bill. I didn't get mine from Amazon so check on the warranty information before considering a purchase. I bought an anniversary version of their GMT Spacematic and because of that it has some extra writing on the dial and a special design on the case back. Other than that, the only thing that differentiates this model is that this lacks the GMT function (if you want that it is a nice function to have and can be found at a similar price to what is currently listed). The sandblasted case/bracelet give it a soft, subtle feel that I really like as it contrasts some of my polished-steel watches. Lastly, it is by no means a small watch, but the case wears slightly smaller than most 40mm watches and the unique angled lugs make it looke good even on smaller wrists.

"My wife bought me a Swatch for X-Mas. She got it while on travel. It cost approximately $125 (""SILVER THAW"" model 5436228073).

Complaints:

1) Swatch store never informed her that the band could not be manually adjusted at home. This is because the links are not the ""user-friendly"" kind that just have clasps. Result: I had to spend $10 to get the thing adjusted at a jeweler (no local Swatch stores).

2) At the time of getting the number of links adjusted, I hand over this brand new watch and immediately the band pin falls out of the thing. A brand new watch that now needs jeweler's adjustment and have a pin fixed. Result: An additional $7 on top of the previous expenses.

3) After getting the band adjusted and a new band pin inserted I figured I'm home free, that I might actually try to enjoy the thing. Wrong. Within only a few hours of wearing it the band pin again falls out. Result: Another $10 to have the thing shipped back to Swatch for a refund.

Overall result: I'm in the hole $27 because of Swatch.

Overall opinion: I know what the ""S"" stands for in Swatch.

Overall advice: Better off with an Armitron watch instead of this wannabe Euro-garbage.

Recommended: No","The ""S"" in Swatch",B0002FCBYG
"I received this watch as a gift and I absolutely love it.  When you tap the face, the hour hands allign at 12 o'clock, and then rotate together clockwise until they stop on one of the six 'bunny sutra' positions.  After a few seconds, they return to telling the time.  Unlike most of the Swatch 'gent' watches, I can't hear its ticking (thank goodness).  The only little glitch is that the 'game' will sometimes start on its own if your wrist is jarred, but it's not annoying enough to make me stop wearing it.  My other Swatch is an Irony called 'Rodeo Flip'",This watch cracks me up!,B0002FCBYG
They're wonderful shoes! This is my second pair that I've owned! I would recommend to anyone! You won't be disappointed!,Excellent shoes!,B0002XLE3W
"To start, these shoes were so ridiculously tight on my toes that I couldn't bear to wear them any more than 15 minutes consecutively. Even came to find out that I got a size too BIG. The left shoe somehow wasn't completely symmetrical to the right. My left heal was loose enough that it would slide around my Achilles while my right was pretty snug. My last problem would be that the company itself (wild sherpa) doesn't cover the return shipping cost putting me almost 10 dollars in the hole just for trying them.",Complete and utter disappointment,B0002XLELE
"WE LOVE THIS WATCH...THE ONLY TWO COMMENTS I HAVE ARE THESE:
1. THE BACK DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ENGRAVING TOO EASILY AND THERE IS NO LID SO YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE YOUR ENGRAVED WORDS BETWEEN THE RATHER LARGE ""KENNETH COLE"" NAME WHICH IS ENGRAVED ON THE BACK.
2. THE CHAIN CONNECTOR, A ""U"" SHAPED DEVICE PULLED OUT EASILY FROM THE BASE OF THE TOP OF THE WATCH...WE HAD TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER SO WE COULD RECONNECT THE CHAIN. MY FATHER IS ELDERLY, AND IN A NURSING HOME AND HAS TO HAVE THE CHAIN FUNCTIONING PROPERLY OR HE WOULD LOSE THE WATCH.
OTHER THAN THESE TWO FLAWS, WE LOVE THE WATCH-MY FATHER CHERISHES IT!",KENNETH COLE POCKET WATCH,B0002T5V8U

"It was February of 2011, and in our area First Communion Dresses were extremely limited and very expensive.  So, I took a chance and ordered this dress.  It arrived safely packed to prevent shipping damage.  The dress was not the least bit crushed in shipping.  It was a perfect fit except for the length.  I altered the hem myself as I have extensive sewing experience. No other child in the communion class was wearing this dress.  It was the perfect dress for my granddaughter.

I started buying them years ago when he was a size 8 slim and now he is almost 12 and is wearing a 14 slim and he has had every size in between.  This cut has been a life saver since the slim is very slim and I hate the look of kids in clothes that don't fit right.

I was so excited because my son is hard to fit, tall and skinny, 8's fit great, but are too short, 9's are long enough, but too big around the waist. These jeans were my answer...so I thought.  I washed them before I'd let him wear them, and they shrank...and now they don't fit...way too tight.  I'm so disappointed.  And of course Amazon won't let me return them for an exchange because they've been washed. $60...flushed.

"These are cute shoes, but my 3-year-old came home from school after her first day wearing these shoes, and threads were already pulling from the seams.

Within a week, the suede-like fabric that covers most of the shoe had already discolored to gray (and it wasn't dirt). I used a brush and suede cleaner (no soap or water), and it didn't help. They looked very old and worn out after only one week.

Also, during the course of a regular outside play at school, she managed to tear the fabric completely off the toe, revealing the beige toe underneath the suede. Her toes were still protected, but it looked terrible. This isn't necessarily due to faulty manufacture; it's just that kids scuff the toes of their shoes.

In summary, these would probably be fine for fashion wear, but I wouldn't recommend for school. In total, they lasted us about a month before I had to throw them away.","Cute, but not durable, practical for toddlers",B000F52ACG

"With the normal 1 to 12 numbering on the dial, and the numbering by the fives (05 to 60) on the outside, this is a great watch for teaching a child to tell time. The only two drawbacks are 1) the hour hand is white, which is sometimes hard to see against the white background, and 2) the two little strips for tucking the end of the band in after fastening it fell off within the first few days of use so the band is always sticking out. My son is still very young (3) with a thin arm, so the watch is too loose for his wrist. Our solution: he wears the watch on his upper arm, over his shirt sleeve. He loves it, and it's easy for him to see and practice reading numbers and time.",Great for teaching a child to tell time,B005OVITUI

"I made the mistake of not reading the other reviews. Dont do the same. I ordered these shoes for my sons communion. They are used! It is so blatant that they used what appears to be a white marker to cover scuff marks. The coverup is shiny and does not match the rest of the shoe. This is upsetting. How can Amazon attach there name to a product and advertise as new when it is obviously used. Name of the seller is Amazon.com, LLC.
UPDATE 4/30/2014  I have elected to return this used pair of shoes in the hopes of receiving a new pair. I will update the review once the ""new"" pair is received.

UPDATE 5/2/2014 I have received the new pair of shoes. These shoes are in fact new. They are very nice. So maybe it is luck of the draw. Should you decide to order them give yourself enough time to return them should they be used. The thing with these type of products are they are 1 time use. So many will use them and clean them up to send them back. So thoroughly inspect them once they arrive.",Amazon is Selling these Used and Advertising as New,B000BF08GA
