Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

Sport timing features include a 100-hour chronograph with lap or split option, 100-lap memory recall, 99 lap counter, on-the-fly recall of lap or split, and interval timers settable up to 24 hours (9 timers with countdown/stop, countdown/repeat, and countdown/auto-start chrono). The training log stores workouts by date, with best lap, average lap, and it offers a 10-memo log, each with up to three 8-character pages. Other features include two time zones with date, five alarms with 5-minute back-up, water resistance to 100 meters (330 feet), and black polyurethane strap with grey accents.

To activate FLIX, put the watch into Night-Mode by pressing and holding the Indiglo night-light button 3 seconds until it beeps. With the watch in Night-Mode, a forward ""flick"" of the wrist with a sharp ""stop"" will activate the Indiglo night-light for three seconds.
The Indiglo night-light uniformly lights the surface of the watch dial using patented blue electroluminescent lighting technology. It uses less battery power than most other watch illumination systems, enabling your watch battery to last longer. The Night Mode feature allows you to illuminate the Indiglo night-light for 3 seconds with any button press, regardless of the mode or function.

The Standard of the West Since 1879 The story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making. H.J. soon began his own boot company, Justin Boots, which he operated out of his home to serve cowboys passing though town. H.J. saw the potential for his business, so when a railroad was built ten years later in Nocona, Texas, he moved his family there to capitalize on a bigger market. In 1908, Justin Boots became a true family company when his sons, Earl and Avis, came to work for their father. Their combined efforts pushed the company forward, and just two years later, Justin Boots had doubled its production and was being sold in 26 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. Seven years after their fathers death in 1918, his sons moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth where it still operates today. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboys who have worn them since 1879. After more than 130 years of Western boot making, Justin Boots is still true to its roots.

The Standard of the West Since 1879 The story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making. H.J. soon began his own boot company, Justin Boots, which he operated out of his home to serve cowboys passing though town. H.J. saw the potential for his business, so when a railroad was built ten years later in Nocona, Texas, he moved his family there to capitalize on a bigger market. In 1908, Justin Boots became a true family company when his sons, Earl and Avis, came to work for their father. Their combined efforts pushed the company forward, and just two years later, Justin Boots had doubled its production and was being sold in 26 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. Seven years after their fathers death in 1918, his sons moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth where it still operates today. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboys who have worn them since 1879. After more than 130 years of Western boot making, Justin Boots is still true to its roots. When you purchase a pair of Justin Boots you will own the most authentic and stylish Western footwear available. And with Justins patented J-Flex Comfort System you will be wearing the most comfortable boots ever made. This is why Justin Boots has been crowned the .Standard Of The West Since 1879..

An iconic Italian fashion trendsetter, the House of Gucci--better known just as Gucci--is renowned for its tradition of luxury and constant quest and attention for style and quality. It was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci when he opened a leather goods company and small luggage store in his home of Florence, Italy. Within a few years, the Gucci label attracted a sophisticated international clientele who sought out its equestrian-inspired collection of bags, trunks, gloves, shoes, and belts. By the 1960s, Gucci products became icons when worn by such fashion icons as Jackie Kennedy (who carried a shoulder bag that today takes her name, Jackie O), Liz Taylor and Grace Kelly. Artistically combining the elegance of Italian design with the precision of Swiss horological craftsmanship, every Gucci timepiece represents watchmaking at its finest. From inception to finish piece, Gucci demands a commitment of the highest standards, attention to detail and exacting quality control. Today's Gucci watches are made of the most durable materials, while design is focused on modernity--tweaking classic watch styles with contemporary lines and flourishes in order to make a mark of this time for years to come.

Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.

About Skagen Skagen Designs was founded in 1987 by Copenhagen natives Henrik and Charlotte Jorst, who operated from the belief that beautifully-designed, high-quality objects can be offered at reasonable prices. Taking their inspiration from the sheer and simple beauty of the Danish coastal landscape, the founders worked with well-known Danish designers to create a collection of elegant timepieces distinguished by their clean, pure lines and sophisticated styling. Skagen watches represent a harmonious blend of spirited design, beautiful craftsmanship, and expert precision.
The Skagen brand takes its name from the fishing village of Skagen, Denmark. In keeping with a European design aesthetic, Skagen watches for men and women are sleek, elegant, and modest timepieces boasting quiet precision.

The History of Skagen Designs In 1987, Henrik and Charlotte Jorst came to the United States from their native Denmark to follow a dream: that of owning and running their own business. Skagen Designs was founded by these two natives of Copenhagen on the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices. The Skagen Collection of watches reflects the Jorsts' creative Danish spirit with clean, elegant designs, skillful craftsmanship and technical perfection. When you purchase a piece from the Skagen Collection, you become part of an international community of Skagen owners who believe in a philosophy of design and manufacturing excellence.  Skagen Trend Spotting In the market place, time never stands still and so our innovation never sits idle. Our design team is on the pulse of current fashions, with regular visits to design centers of the world including Denmark, Switzerland,Italy, France, New York and Hong Kong. We are never content to follow established trends. We stay true to our classic design philosophy and interpret trends accordingly. We observe, listen and innovate - all to create lasting design pieces. The Result The production of such lasting design pieces often demands special processes and tooling. These are often a challenge to create; however, we are never satisfied with ""close enough"". We continually push and fine-tune designs to stay true to our standards. We know what we want and are not satisfied until the design, material and workmanship are all just right. The result of such hard work and dedication speak for themselves in the jaw dropping enthusiasm and excitement created whenever anyone views our product line.
Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.

Water resistant to 99 feet (30 M): withstands rain and splashes of water, but not showering or submersion
","Blending Asian and old English design, this watch is highlighted by a unique, hand-crafted sterling silver link-style bracelet band. The watch also features a small, square sterling silver bezel, stainless steel housing, and shimmery teal dial background. The watch's bezel is polished sterling silver and the center of its dial is decorated with a swooping vine pattern. It also features a subsidiary dial above the 30-minute mark that shows running seconds.
The sterling silver bracelet band is composed of H-shaped sections of paisley-like filigree patterns with granulated accents set against a black background. They're joined together by small squares filled with a silver cut-out pattern. The interior of the band is smooth against the skin. The band is joined together by a stainless steel butterfly clasp that's easy to release and swing open or snap back into place.
Special features and dimensions:  Swiss made watch, hand-crafted band. 3 ATM water resistance rating (safe to 30 meters, can withstand gentle splashes but is not suitable for swimming). Luminous hands glow in the dark. Watch dimensions: 1.1 inches (including winder) wide, 1.3 inches long Band width: 0.69 inches Battery can be replaced by professional jeweler. Average battery life is approximately 18 months, but will vary according to environmental conditions.  The industry standard for jewelry, sterling silver is composed of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper (which helps to toughen the silver). Stainless steel is an extremely durable metal alloy that's virtually immune to rust, discoloration, and corrosion.
Lois Hill's signature of fusing and reinventing the ancient into contemporary and timeless pieces of art are transformed into an amazing timepiece that is much more than jewelry--it's reflective of your personality and sense of style. It can be worn alone as a simple statement, or as the finishing touch to complete any look.
Warranty The Lois Hill International Limited Warranty guarantees your watch for two (2) years from date of purchase under the following conditions: any defect or flaw that is determined by Lois Hill technical staff to be the result of a manufacturing fault will be repaired or replaced by Lois Hill free of charge.
Care & Maintenance of Your Sterling Silver Watch Band  The band of your Lois Hill watch is sterling silver and should be polished periodically with a polishing cloth. It is important not to use any dips or creams when cleaning your band, as the patina of the oxidation will be lost. The bracelet may be cleaned from general daily wear with a mixture of mild soap and warm water on a soft brush or soft cloth.

With the slightest kick, the split blade deflects to form a pair of wings that slice through the water with reduced drag, creating lift in the forward direction to propel you ahead. Compared to conventional fins, the splitfin swims with less effort, stress and strain resulting in greater sustained speed, powerfort. Independent testing has shown that this design can significantly reduce air consumption! the atomic aquatics splitfins virtually eliminate muscle strain, fatigue and cramping to enable you to swim longer distances against stronger currents. Divers have reported being able to make headway against currents they would not normally be able toe with paddle type fins.

As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time.

","Make a powerful statement with this U.S. Army-authorized stainless steel chronograph watch. Large and in charge, the watch measures 1.5 inches wide and .4 inches tall. It has a brushed, rotating stainless steelb bezel and textured case siding. The brushed stainless steel bracelet band is composed of a center square piece that's framed by two thin exterior pieces.
This chronograph watch has an independent stopwatch for short interval timing. The top push button stops and starts the time-measuring function and the bottom button resets it. The subdial at the top serves as a 60-second counter for the chronograph while the bottom subdial counts 1/10 of a second increments. The subdial at the 9 o'clock position measures 12-hour increments.
Other features include:  Black face background Japan quartz movement Three-hand display with thick, luminous hour and minute hands, yellow second hand, and yellow subdial hands Date function at the 4 o'clock position Two-sided push mechanism opens butterfly clasp easily; also features lifting lock U.S. Army logo and ridged crown with embossed U.S. Army star  A very durable metal alloy (usually containing 10-20% chromium), stainless steel is virtually immune to rust, discoloration, and corrosion.
Water Resistance This watch is water resistant to 330 feet (or 100 meters--a 10 ATM rating). It can be used for pool-side diving or snorkeling. Before using the watch in or near water, be sure that the crown is pushed in completely. If the watch is underwater or wet, do not use pushers, rotating bezels, or crowns. Once it has become wet, wipe it dry as soon as possible; if it comes in contact with salt water, rinse cases and bracelets immediately and thoroughly with fresh water.
Warranty This watch is warranted to the owner against all defects in material or workmanship. This warranty does not apply to normal wear and tear or abuse and excludes batteries, case, strap, crystal, and bracelet. The movement of any timepiece requires periodic cleaning/timing, which is not a defect and, as such, not warranted.
Watch Glossary Terms  Bezel: The surface ring on the watch that surrounds and holds the crystal in place. A rotatating bezel, found with some sport watches, is useful in calculating elapsed times. Case: The metal housing of a watch's mechanical parts; sits below the bezel and face. Crown: Also known as the winder, it is a button that extends from the case that adjusts time and/or date. Crystal: The clear cover over the watch face, ranging from plastic to mineral crystal (heat-treated for better scratch resistance) to sapphire crystal (most expensive and durable) Dial: The printing or application of the watch's numerals, indices, or surface design. Face: The visible side of the watch where the dial is contained, showing either Arabic or Roman numerals.

","TOETOE Essential Socks are probably the most comfortable socks you will ever wear. The foot evolved to provide maximum feedback to the brain about our body's sense of its own position, balance and movement - this is called proprioception. Toe movement is an important part of this process and the toe separation encouraged by TOETOE Socks helps the foot and the brain function better. The foot is a dexterous and sensitive masterpiece. However, conventional socks limit the feedback to the brain by causing the toes to act as one unit. TOETOE Socks however allow each toe to move individually increasing the foot's potential to provide proprioceptive feedback. They are ideal for everyday wear. Suitable to be worn with any shoes they are soft, comfortable and easy to put on. Conventional socks allow moisture to accumulate between your toes creating an ideal environment for bacteria and fungus to thrive - that's what causes embarrassing foot odour.
",B0001ONF16,Men Clothing,"TOETOE Essential Socks enhance foot sensation by allowing individual toe movement, promoting proprioception (balance and movement awareness).

","In the mid-seventies, the Swiss watch industry was in the midst of its worst crisis ever. Technologically speaking, the Japanese competition had been outclassed in 1979 with the launch of the ""Delirium,"" the worlds thinnest wristwatch with a limited number of components. But the event that marked the upturn in the industrys fortunes was the founding of SMH, the Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking Industries. And its answer to the crisis was Swatch-a slim plastic watch with only 51 components (instead of the usual 91 parts or more) that combined top quality with a highly affordable price. It first went on sale in 1983. Since this time, it has gone on to become the most successful wristwatch of all time, and The Swatch Group, the parent company, is the largest and most dynamic watch company in the world.
The Swatch brand was established in 1983 to meet a need in the market for affordable timepieces with Swiss craftsmanship.

The Standard of the West Since 1879 The story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making. H.J. soon began his own boot company, Justin Boots, which he operated out of his home to serve cowboys passing though town. H.J. saw the potential for his business, so when a railroad was built ten years later in Nocona, Texas, he moved his family there to capitalize on a bigger market. In 1908, Justin Boots became a true family company when his sons, Earl and Avis, came to work for their father. Their combined efforts pushed the company forward, and just two years later, Justin Boots had doubled its production and was being sold in 26 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. Seven years after their fathers death in 1918, his sons moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth where it still operates today. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboys who have worn them since 1879. After more than 130 years of Western boot making, Justin Boots is still true to its roots. When you purchase a pair of Justin Boots you will own the most authentic and stylish Western footwear available. And with Justins patented J-Flex.Comfort System you will be wearing the most comfortable boots ever made. This is why Justin Boots has been crowned the Standard Of The West Since 1879.

Based in the Neuchâtel area of the Jura Mountains, in Le Locle, Switzerland, Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son Charles-Emile created the watch making company Tissot in 1853. Whether in the technology of its movements, in the research for special materials or in the very functions of the watch itself, Tissot's engineers and watchmakers have developed pioneering timepieces over the years.
Some of Tissot's triumphs over the years include the the Idea 2001 (the world's first plastic watch) released in 1971, the Rock watch (which set the timepiece's movement in a stone case made from Swiss Alps granite) in 1985, and the Wood watch from 1988 (with a completely wooden case). Tissot uses the best movements (from ETA SA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse), the highest quality materials (316L steel, 18K gold, titanium) and scratch-proof glasses (sapphire crystal--at least 2500 Vickers).
The company has been involved with high profile sports events since 1974 when they sponsored a racing car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, France. Since then Tissot's timepieces have been chosen as official timekeepers for world championships in cycling, motorcycling, fencing and ice hockey. And Tissot is currently the the official watch and timekeeper of NASCAR.
Tissot timepieces have been worn by a bevy of celebrities over the years--including Grace Kelly, Elvis Presley and Nelson Mandela--and James Stewart's character L.B. Jefferies wore a Tissot timepiece in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" Today the company is represented in a variety of sporting fields by English soccer star Michael Owen, IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, and MotoGP world champion Nicky Hayden. Today, Tissot is a member of the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch producer and distributor.

","The Fortis Men's 626.22.32 M Spacematic Eco Gray Stainless Steel Watch is an intrepid timepiece from a brand that has grown up in the pages of aviation history. Featuring a grey analog dial, date display and a grey stainless steel band, this watch boasts a fearless design with unparalleled style.

FORTIS belongs to the traditional Swiss watch brands, which has been active since its foundation in 1912 without interruption. As the world's first manufacturer of automatic wristwatches in 1926, FORTIS went down in watch history by producing the first automatic watch, the legendary Harwood, in a series production. In the middle of the '50s and '60s, to the climax of the automatic wristwatches, FORTIS enjoyed a good reputation as well as a worldwide brand awareness and distribution network.
In the '80s, FORTIS was known as a manufacturer of functional, reliable mechanical wristwatches. In 1994, after endurance tests on the borderline of modern physics, the Star City Training Center chose the FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph as part of their Official Cosmonauts' equipment. Since then, FORTIS automatic wristwatches have proven their space capability in several missions, even outside of the protective space station in outer space.
Based on the intensive collaboration with the experts in space travel, a unique new watch was developed: The FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph Automatic Alarm. A real spin-off from space and a world's first, the company came out with the FORTIS chronograph automatic with a mechanical alarm. With the development of this movement, FORTIS has earned a lot of approval from competitors and the professional world.
Exactly 10 years after the first official flight, FORTIS was reconfirmed in 2004 as the official wristwatch supplier of the Russian Space program on board of the ISS still today. FORTIS will also accompany space travelers for the first Mars mission as the official supplier of the Mars 500 mission, which started in June 2010 and will take more than one and half years to complete. Crew members can rely on their FORTIS Automatic watches during this long test trip.
As a longtime partner of space organizations, FORTIS invests in modern technologies and ensures in this way the future of the 100-year old brand in an ever-changing watch market.

Raymond Weil, located in the heart of Geneva, Switzerland, is one of the last independent Swiss luxury watch companies. Even more uniquely, the company has remained a family business and is currently managed by Raymond Weil's son-in-law Olivier Bernheim, and his sons, Elie and Pierre Bernheim.
Raymond Weil opened his watch-making business in 1976 during a very difficult period for mechanical watches. At the time, quartz watches were swiftly replacing their predecessors as a more affordable and equally accurate alternative. However, due to his 26 years of experience in the industry, Raymond Weil's design concepts, impeccable, mechanical movements, and commitment to entirely Swiss-made products earned him a clientele that continued to expand over the past 37 years.
Despite the company's current popularity, these high standards have not relaxed, and each Raymond Weil watch passes 350 different checks before being put on the market. Raymond Weil's in-depth knowledge of horology has earned him several prestigious recognitions, including being named President of the Watch Manufacturer's Union of Geneva, Vice President of the Watch Industry's Training Center in Lausanne, member of the Watchmakers' Federation, and President of the Exhibitors' Committee of the World Watch-making and Jewelry Exhibition at Basel.
The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.

","Empowering adventure since 1935, the Authentic Original has become an icon of seaworthy style. With genuine leather materials hand sewn for durability, a signature 360 lacing system for a secure fit, and Wave-Siping for ultimate wet/dry traction, these classics are just as purpose-built now as they were back then.
Best known for boat shoes that have logged more miles of open ocean than any other brand, the Sperry Top-Sider story began on a raw winter day in New England. When avid sailor and hobbyist inventor Paul Sperry let his dog Prince out for his daily exercise, he noticed that the cocker spaniel was remarkably stable, even at a full run on the snow covered, icy crust. Paul raced back to his laboratory to begin working. Using pieces of rubber, a razor blade, and an ordinary sneaker, Paul had soon pieced together the prototype of the world's first boat shoe. Subsequent designs yielded the original Sperry Top-Sider now known as the Authentic Original. Since 1935, Sperry Top-Sider has been the leading brand of footwear for those who love the water. From its introduction of the world's first siped rubber outsole for non-marking traction, to its advanced technical fabrication to combat the elements, Sperry Top-Sider remains the vanguard of high-performance amphibious footwear. Available around the globe in fine independent, marine, and department stores, Sperry Top-Sider is the official footwear of the U.S. Sailing Team, Zodiac Academy, the World Billfish Series, and the Shimano Fishing Tour.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

","Double-H 9714 Men's 8 Inch Black Walnut Leather Lacer Boots have the rugged look of logger-style footwear. They would look great with a flannel shirt, worn blue jeans and a thick, woolen cap. But the best boots aren't tough and hard -- they're soft and sweet, just like this pair. Sure they've got a rough exterior, but that's just to scare wear and tear away. The black walnut leather uppers have a deep, reddish-brown tone. Full-grain leather is tough cowhide, left unprocessed to retain its natural flexibility. The leather is wear-resistant and tough against weather.The vamp is lined with anti-bacterial Bactex to kill odors. The Vitalize insoles are made to cushion prime impact zones, absorbing shock and softening steps. The AG7 Airthrust wedge outsoles are made in a long-wearing, cushioning design. Oil-resistance protects the tread against common corrosive chemicals, while slip-resistance helps you keep your footing even in dangerous conditions. The 1 1/4 inch heels give you a little bit of lift, and extra grip when you're standing on ladders and other narrow spaces.EH rated, these boots are made for electrical hazard resistance. The soles will absorb up to 600 volts of electricity, protecting you around open circuits. Made in the USA, Double-H 9714 Men's 8 Inch Black Walnut Leather Lacer Boots are rugged and tough -- a real man's boot. The outside is rough and tough, but the insides are soft and cushioning.Sizes Manufactured: D 7-12,13 | EE 7-12,13

","Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker.

","Justin's J-flex comfort system ensures feet are as cushioned as they are stylish in this rugged, moc-toe ankle boot.
The Standard of the West Since 1879 The story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making. H.J. soon began his own boot company, Justin Boots, which he operated out of his home to serve cowboys passing though town. H.J. saw the potential for his business, so when a railroad was built ten years later in Nocona, Texas, he moved his family there to capitalize on a bigger market. In 1908, Justin Boots became a true family company when his sons, Earl and Avis, came to work for their father. Their combined efforts pushed the company forward, and just two years later, Justin Boots had doubled its production and was being sold in 26 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. Seven years after their fathers death in 1918, his sons moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth where it still operates today. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboys who have worn them since 1879. After more than 130 years of Western boot making, Justin Boots is still true to its roots. When you purchase a pair of Justin Boots you will own the most authentic and stylish Western footwear available. And with Justins patented J-Flex Comfort System you will be wearing the most comfortable boots ever made. This is why Justin Boots has been crowned the .Standard Of The West Since 1879..

","Your little ballerina will enjoy this classic style from Capezio. The leather shoe features a split sole design with suede patches that let her glide and turn easily, and its free floating arch helps her to point her little toes effortlessly as well.
Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.

Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.

","Field boots done right. That's what we say about these Matterhorn 102494 10 Inch Waterproof Leather Insulated Safety Toe Boots. They're engineered with all the features you need to stay protected, comfortable and field-ready day after day.Sleek full-grain, waterproof leather uppers make these black Work Boots rugged and durable (not to mention quite handsome too). The tall, 10-inch design features a traditional lace-up style and padded collars for a more comfortable fit. Matterhorn employs Goodyear Welt construction methods to attach the uppers to the soles. Stitched rather than glued, Goodyear welted boots stand up better to rough wear and are fully repairable for years of added life. Vibram Sierra soles offer outstanding slip- and oil-resistant traction on a variety of terrains for superior grip you can count on. You'll appreciate the ASTM-approved, Composite toes when your assignments start to get rough. Designed to guard against impacts and falling objects, they'll keep your feet protected from the hazards of the jobsite. Speaking of protection, you'll find Gore-Tex booties in this pair as well. Engineered to work just like your skin, Gore-Tex employs tiny pores to allow moisture vapor to escape while blocking water molecules from entering. That means you can count on a dry, breathable fit. Matterhorn added 200-gram Thinsulate insulation to keep out the cold. Much thinner and lighter than traditional insulation materials, Thinsulate delivers outstanding warmth without lots of added weight and bulk.Breathable Cambrelle lines the inside of this pair to wick away perspiration from your feet. Removable DRYZ inserts add another layer of moisture protection and fight odor for fresh wear. The inserts are designed to absorb shock as well for more comfortable wear and less fatigue and pain after long days on your feet. To top it off, this pair boasts shock-absorbing polyurethane midsoles and lightweight fiberglass shanks for improved stability, control and support where

Made of polyurethane, they can not only withstand all kinds of weather, mud, and hosing down, but also they're lightweight, flexible, and virtually indestructible.

Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.

Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.

This action causes the snitch to light up in blue and makes it appear to flutter across the dial. The round dial has silvertone hands, including a second hand, but no numbers or indexes to take away from the cool dial image. Instead, the silvertone bezel features small raised dots that serve as hour markers. The dial is housed in a round case that measures about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and features a hypoallergenic stainless steel back. This watch presents on a black genuine leather strap with a smooth tan manmade backing and fastens with a buckle closure. It features Japan quartz movement and is water resistant to 30 meters.
This watch comes packaged in a cool-looking tin embellished with Harry Potter images. Harry himself graces the lid, striking a dramatic pose with his wand. Along the sides are pictures of Hogwarts Castle and of Harry's trusty messenger owl, Hedwig. In a clever design feature, the bottom of the tin is equipped with two coin slots, so that once kids have removed the watch, they can flip the tin over and re-use it as a piggy bank.

Ice Petal AmberWatch,"Children's Loud Alert Safety Watch
Protect your child from predators and other threats
Digital watch with full features
Hip, cute style and color
One year warranty
","AmberWatch has created a children's digital watch that arms our children against child predators and and other threats. The AmberWatch was designed with a security system that draws attention to children in trouble by using an audio and visual alert system. When a child is in trouble he or she just pushes the two red buttons and the AmberWatch alert is triggered. With sound blaring at 115dB, which can be heard 100+ yards away, and super bright LEDs flashing a visible warning alert, attention is brought to the child in danger helping minimize the risk of abduction or injury. Includes batteries,quickstart guide, and 1 yr warranty card. Please arm your children with the AmberWatch and keep all of our children safe. For every watch sold AmberWatch donates proceeds to the AmberWatch foundation-a nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention of child abduction and child endangerment.
The most effective means of protecting children from predators is giving them tools to prevent abduction. The AmberWatch was designed to complement safety plans made with parents and to aid in an immediate escape. It is a 115-decibel alarm built into a watch that, when activated, can be heard from 100 yards away. An unmistakable distress signal, it draws attention to dangerous situations and helps children respond strongly when they feel threatened. It can also come into use when a child is lost in a store, park or crowd, when theyre threatened by an animal, if theyre hurt, or if they get lost while participating in activities such as camping, skiing or hiking. The watch has a bulky modern style and super-bright LED lights that can be seen night or day. Digital functions include time, date, alarm, stopwatch, day of the week, low battery and backlight. The alarm is activated by pushing both of the red buttons on either side of the face and deactivated using the same 2 buttons in a coded sequence you set yourself. A special break-away back-up system automatically activates the alarm if the watch is forcibly removed. Amber Watch donates $1 to the AmberWatch Foundation for every watch sold. Water resistant. Adjusts to 6 sizes, approx. 5-3/4L"" to 7-3/4L"". Flower design bezel with an ice pink band.

","Made from 360g mtr fleece, this jacket is as rugged, warm, and durable as it is soft
When you can't be there on the slope to wrap your arms around your child, let this fleece sweater do the hugging. The Steens Mountain Sweater from Columbia Sportswear features 100% polyester non-pilling MTR fleece that dries quickly and continues to insulate when wet. Fleece-lined pockets warm chilled fingers.

About Columbia Sportswear Founded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of ski-wear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.
Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that, it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60-year-old Gert began her role as ""Mother Boyle"" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.
The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.

","AmberWatch has created a children's digital watch that arms our children against child predators and and other threats. The AmberWatch was designed with a security system that draws attention to children in trouble by using an audio and visual alert system. When a child is in trouble he or she just pushes the two red buttons and the AmberWatch alert is triggered. With sound blaring at 115dB, which can be heard 100+ yards away, and super bright LEDs flashing a visible warning alert, attention is brought to the child in danger helping minimize the risk of abduction or injury. Includes batteries,quickstart guide, and 1 yr warranty card. Please arm your children with the AmberWatch and keep all of our children safe. For every watch sold AmberWatch donates proceeds to the AmberWatch foundation-a nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention of child abduction and child endangerment.
The most effective means of protecting children from predators is giving them tools to prevent abduction. The AmberWatch was designed to complement safety plans made with parents and to aid in an immediate escape. It is a 115-decibel alarm built into a watch that, when activated, can be heard from 100 yards away. An unmistakable distress signal, it draws attention to dangerous situations and helps children respond strongly when they feel threatened. It can also come into use when a child is lost in a store, park or crowd, when theyre threatened by an animal, if theyre hurt, or if they get lost while participating in activities such as camping, skiing or hiking. The watch has a bulky modern style and super-bright LED lights that can be seen night or day. Digital functions include time, date, alarm, stopwatch, day of the week, low battery and backlight. The alarm is activated by pushing both of the red buttons on either side of the face and deactivated using the same 2 buttons in a coded sequence you set yourself. A special break-away back-up system automatically activates the alarm if the watch is forcibly removed. Amber Watch donates $1 to the AmberWatch Foundation for every watch sold. Water resistant. Adjusts to 6 sizes, approx. 5-3/4L"" to 7-3/4L"". Brushed chrome bezel with a reflex blue band.

About Nike At its core, Nike understands the need for play, no matter what your age. And as Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman would say--if you have a body, you're an athlete. Nike's line of youth watches blends the advanced materials and drive for excellence built into the company's adult watches with the same mix of sophistication, guts, and imagination as the kids who wear them. They made to fit kid-sized wrists and sport fun, contemporary designs that will look great in school and out on the playfield.
Beyond shoes--from watches and eyewear to carry gear and even socks--Nike is committed to giving athletes of every make, model and body style, who compete and recreate in ways never before imagined, the very best performance product. Here are just a few important dates in Nike's journey:  American record-holder Steve Prefontaine becomes the first major track athlete to wear Nike brand shoes in 1973. At the 1976 Olympic Trials, Nike shoes are seen in abundance for the first time--worn by young, rising stars in both middle- and long-distance events. The first athlete to win an Olympic medal wearing Nike shoes is British runner, Steve Ovett in the 1980 Moscow Games The Just Do It advertising campaign began in 1988, and is now ensconced in the Americana exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum.

Protect your child from predators and other threats
Digital watch with full features

","AmberWatch has created a children's digital watch that arms our children against child predators and and other threats. The AmberWatch was designed with a security system that draws attention to children in trouble by using an audio and visual alert system. When a child is in trouble he or she just pushes the two red buttons and the AmberWatch alert is triggered. With sound blaring at 115dB, which can be heard 100+ yards away, and super bright LEDs flashing a visible warning alert, attention is brought to the child in danger helping minimize the risk of abduction or injury. Includes batteries,quickstart guide, and 1 yr warranty card. Please arm your children with the AmberWatch and keep all of our children safe. For every watch sold AmberWatch donates proceeds to the AmberWatch foundation-a nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention of child abduction and child endangerment.
The most effective means of protecting children from predators is giving them tools to prevent abduction. The AmberWatch was designed to complement safety plans made with parents and to aid in an immediate escape. It is a 115-decibel alarm built into a watch that, when activated, can be heard from 100 yards away. An unmistakable distress signal, it draws attention to dangerous situations and helps children respond strongly when they feel threatened. It can also come into use when a child is lost in a store, park or crowd, when theyre threatened by an animal, if theyre hurt, or if they get lost while participating in activities such as camping, skiing or hiking. The watch has a bulky modern style and super-bright LED lights that can be seen night or day. Digital functions include time, date, alarm, stopwatch, day of the week, low battery and backlight. The alarm is activated by pushing both of the red buttons on either side of the face and deactivated using the same 2 buttons in a coded sequence you set yourself. A special break-away back-up system automatically activates the alarm if the watch is forcibly removed. Amber Watch donates $1 to the AmberWatch Foundation for every watch sold. Water resistant. Adjusts to 6 sizes, approx. 5-3/4L"" to 7-3/4L"". Purple glitter bezel with a purple band.

","Harry Potter Unisex #HC0414
This whimsical Harry Potter collectible watch is a playful reproduction of the famous grandfather clock used by the diligent Mrs. Weasley to track the location and well-being of her family members at all times.  The goldtone case highlights a blue inner dial framed by a swirling orange outer dial featuring possible locations and states of being.  Oval-tipped goldtone hands point to Quidditch, School, Travel, Home, Dentist, Prison, Lost, and--most ominously--Mortal Peril. (Note how the danger seems to grow with the advancing hour!)  In case you want to know the time as well, simple goldtone dot markers on the inner dial do the job nicely.  There's even a second hand, for those who value precision.  The watch is showcased on a mahogany leather strap with a buckle closure and comes packaged in a fiery red and orange Goblet of Fire collectible tin.

","The most effective means of protecting children from predators is giving them tools to prevent abduction. The AmberWatch was designed to complement safety plans made with parents and to aid in an immediate escape. It is a 115-decibel alarm built into a watch that, when activated, can be heard from 100 yards away. An unmistakable distress signal, it draws attention to dangerous situations and helps children respond strongly when they feel threatened. It can also come into use when a child is lost in a store, park or crowd, when theyre threatened by an animal, if theyre hurt, or if they get lost while participating in activities such as camping, skiing or hiking. The watch has a bulky modern style and super-bright LED lights that can be seen night or day. Digital functions include time, date, alarm, stopwatch, day of the week, low battery and backlight. The alarm is activated by pushing both of the red buttons on either side of the face and deactivated using the same 2 buttons in a coded sequence you set yourself. A special break-away back-up system automatically activates the alarm if the watch is forcibly removed. Amber Watch donates $1 to the AmberWatch Foundation for every watch sold. Water resistant. Adjusts to 6 sizes, approx. 5-3/4L"" to 7-3/4L"".

","Simply put, the Air Jordan 1 is the sneaker that started it all. Michael Jordan's first signature model was released in 1985, and is the only Air Jordan model that sports a Nike Swoosh.

About Nike Nike watches are built to endure extreme outdoor conditions without missing a beat and they adhere to the company's founding mission statement: to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And as Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman would add--if you have a body, you're an athlete. Ever since the fateful day in 1971 when University of Oregon track coach Bowerman poured rubber into his wife's waffle iron, technological innovation has been the spark that lights Nike's fire. The Waffle outsole transformed the running world and soon after Nike Air evolved Nike's revolutionary impact on sports. Beyond shoes--from watches and eyewear to carry gear and even socks--Nike is committed to giving athletes of every make, model and body style, who compete and recreate in ways never before imagined, the very best performance product. Here are just a few important dates in Nike's journey:  American record-holder Steve Prefontaine becomes the first major track athlete to wear Nike brand shoes in 1973. At the 1976 Olympic Trials, Nike shoes are seen in abundance for the first time--worn by young, rising stars in both middle- and long-distance events. The first athlete to win an Olympic medal wearing Nike shoes is British runner, Steve Ovett in the 1980 Moscow Games The Just Do It advertising campaign began in 1988, and is now ensconced in the Americana exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum.

As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

","The name ‘LEGO’ is an abbreviation of the two Danish words “leg godt”, meaning “play well”. It’s our name and it’s our ideal.
The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen. The Company has passed from father to son and remains a family owned business even today: Owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder.
It has come a long way over the past almost 80 years – from a small carpenter’s workshop to a modern, global enterprise.
The LEGO Group is a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. The company is still owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family who founded it in 1932.
The LEGO Group is engaged in the development of children’s creativity through playing and learning and it is this core philosophy that is built into every LEGO brand watch and clock.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

","Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.
",B002LAR1LS,Boys Watches,"Casio's wristwatches, introduced in 1974, have evolved from digital timepieces to solar-powered and Bluetooth-enabled devices. Known for their Superman-themed watch featuring a red and black strap, blue dial, and digital display, Casio watches have a clear resin case measuring 34mm in diameter."
